The mood was somber as many community members were still coming to terms with what happened in the early hours of Wednesday morning. One man said that his Airbnb guests from London were shaken. "We had guests returning to our Airbnb at about 1.30am in the morning and we really didn't know what was going on. It was all a bit confusing and we were just trying to console them and figure how we were going to get over it." No arrests have been made.
