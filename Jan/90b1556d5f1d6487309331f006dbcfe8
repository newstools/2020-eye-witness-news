CAPE TOWN - Southern Kings prop Pieter Scholtz faced a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday via video conference and has been banned for four weeks. A disciplinary panel convened in Neath to consider the red-card shown to Pieter Scholtz during the Kings' Round 10 PRO14 fixture against Edinburgh on 4 January 2020. The Port Elizabeth based side lost the match 61-13. The player was shown a red card by referee Joy Neville under Law 9.11 – A player must not do anything that is reckless or dangerous to others. The panel, comprising of Rhian Williams (chairperson), Simon Thomas and Nigel Williams (all Wales) concluded that there was an act of foul play which merited a mid-range entry point due to contact with the neck/head area of his opponent. The player’s previous record and behaviour during the process were considered and mitigation of 40% was applied. As a result, Scholtz has been banned for four weeks. He is free to play from Sunday, 16 February 2020.
