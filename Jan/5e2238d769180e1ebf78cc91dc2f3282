Taariq Fielies believes it's in the players' interest to adapt to coach Jan Olde Riekerink's philosophy. CAPE TOWN - Cape Town City FC defender Taariq Fielies on Tuesday said players should accept that coaches do come and go and they could not be holding onto the past. Fielies believes it's in the players' interest to adapt to coach Jan Olde Riekerink's philosophy. Following their 2-0 victory over Bidvest Wits over the weekend, the Citizens are three points clear of the relegation zone in 12th position. Fielies said despite being out for a very long time due to injury, he was fit and wanted to help the team to achieve its goal. He said Benni McCarthy was now the past and it was time to move on. "I think coaches come and go; Benni is now in the past, so we now just have to continue with this coach's philosophy," said Fielies. "The team is positive that we will get out of the situation we're in, we're not thinking there yet because if we start thinking about it, there will be a negative vibe in the camp. So everyone is still very positive. I'm feeling okay and feeling fit, I just want to help the team get into a better position where we're not in the bottom fighting for the survival." Next match for the Cape-based side will see them host Black Leopards on Friday at Cape Town Stadium.
