The Proteas Women open their pool campaign against England Women in Perth, followed by clashes against Thailand Women and Pakistan Women before ending the pool stages against West Indies Women. Moreeng said they have put together a well-balanced side. "We have assembled a team that we feel can hold their own against anyone in the world and it will be important that we carry that belief into the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup. The players we have at our disposal are some of the best and most promising players in women’s cricket globally and we will make sure that we give them the best tools to succeed on this big stage," he said. Captain Dane van Niekerk said the team is embracing the challenge. "There is always going to be pressure at any form of international cricket. If you go to a World Cup and you aren’t confident in your abilities then you don’t have to rock up, we have to go there to win otherwise might as well not go," she said. The tournament begins on 21 February and runs until 8 March, International Women’s Day.
