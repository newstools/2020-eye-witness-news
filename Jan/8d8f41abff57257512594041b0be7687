"It is one of the most difficult infections to treat. Currently, we are managing the seven [babies] that are still alive and we've put into place systems to ensure that the outbreak doesn't continue and that it is contained in the neonatal unit. More admissions have been diverted to Steve Biko and other surrounding neonatal units." The National Institute for Communicable Diseases said that there were preventative measures that the Gauteng Health Department could take to stop the spread of CRE. The NCID's Nelesh Govender: "Infections caused by CRE strains are difficult to treat and we recommend strict adherence to contact precautions which include isolating babies with these infections in separate cubicles."
