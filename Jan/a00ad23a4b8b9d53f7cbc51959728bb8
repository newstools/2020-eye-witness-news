The Education Department had been struggling to place some pupils due to late registration, outstanding documents and other issues. The Gauteng Education Department was gearing up for a busy day tomorrow as it kickstarts the 2020 academic year. MEC Panyaza Lesufi said that parents of grade 1 and 8 pupils who have not yet applied would be allowed from tomorrow until the 24 January to apply. "We are now opening for late registration tomorrow and I say reluctantly so because we are now overburdening the system." He said that one of the biggest challenges facing the department was capacity, with some parents unwilling to accept their placement offers. Parents who had not submitted the required documents and those who still needed assistance were advised to visit their district offices.
