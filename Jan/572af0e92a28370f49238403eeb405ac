RAMALLAH - Palestinian officials threatened Sunday to withdraw from key provisions of the Oslo Accords, which define relations with Israel if US President Donald Trump  announces his Middle East peace plan next week. Chief Palestinian negotiation Saeb Erekat told AFP that the Palestinian Liberation Organisation  reserved the right "to withdraw from the interim agreement", the concrete part of the Oslo deal, if Trump unveils his plan. The Trump initiative will turn Israel's "temporary occupation (of Palestinian territory) into a permanent occupation", Erekat said.
