Dr Swart explained that the official scientific name of the butterfly species is Pieridae and in simple terms, the butterfly is known as the brown-veined white butterfly. What's happening is called the annual white butterfly migration, which happens around mid-summer time in South Africa. "The butterflies originate from arid places in the country such as the Karoo and head in a north-easterly direction towards Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal." Dr Swart said the butterflies are an important part of the ecosystem as they serve as food for other insects and birds. The number of butterflies migrating every year depends on the food available to them from the areas they originate, which in term affects how they pupate and lay eggs. Numbers differ from year to year. "It can take between two to four days for the brown-veined white butterfly to reach its destination as it flies across the country," Dr Swart explained. They‚Äôre here! The annual mid summer butterfly migration descends on the garden where I work. I used this annual migration in a scene in JOHANNESBURG.
