A forensic report has found Naik was involved with corrupt dealings. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) is planning a motion of no confidence against its George Mayor Melvin Naik. A forensic report has found Naik was involved with corrupt dealings. The report will also be tabled at a council meeting on Thursday. The DA's Geordin Hill-Lewis said there are taking all possible steps against Naik. “We were in a caucus meeting in George and the agenda on the caucus meeting is a motion of no confidence in the mayor. If that motion passes under the DA’s constitution, then the Fedex has the right to ask him to resign as mayor.” He said the party would not tolerate any hint of corruption in any DA government and would take swift action. The party said the forensic report commissioned by Western Cape Local Government MEC Anton Bredell would be tabled at the next council meeting.
