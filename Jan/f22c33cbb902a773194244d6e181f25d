The 29-year-old finished last season's National First Division campaign as the second-highest goal scorer with 13 goals, six behind club mate Iqraam Rayners. CAPE TOWN - Stellenbosch FC forward Waseem Isaacs has vowed to score 13 or more goals for his team in the Absa Premiership campaign. The 29-year-old finished last season's National First Division campaign as the second-highest goal scorer with 13 goals, six behind club mate Iqraam Rayners. Isaacs is currently on eight Absa Premiership goals this season after nineteen matches for the Stellenbosch-based side. The 11th-placed Stellenbosch will host Polokwane City (15th) on Saturday at the Cape Town Stadium. Isaacs admitted that coming to the PSL, he had set himself a target for goals he wanted to score. "I told myself I want to score more than what I've scored last season. I scored 13, so I told myself I want more or at least the same," said Isaacs. "Physically I had to be better than I was last season - and mentally because it was a huge step for me in my career - NFD [GladAfrica Championship] and PSL (Premier Soccer League) are totally different." Isaacs said that head coach Steve Barker plays a huge role in his career. "Coach plays a big role for me because he has confidence in me and always believes I can do better," continues Isaacs. "He believes I can go on and be a top goal goalscorer in the league."
