There were many tears from parents when their children arrived on the school bus on the field at Parktown Boys' High. Parents have started leaving the school with their children. Some parents spoke to Eyewitness News while they waited for their children to arrive. “I was shaking because I just imagined life without my son. I was disappointed because when you send your kids to a camp, you send them knowing they’re in safe hands,” one mother said. Another added: “One of the parents called me to ask how I was and where I was. She asked where my son was and I said he was at a camp. She asked whether I was aware that a boy was missing. I was traumatised and shaking.”  UPDATE 2: #ParktownBoysCamp . I met with the family of the missing child on site and they granted us permission to release his photo.
