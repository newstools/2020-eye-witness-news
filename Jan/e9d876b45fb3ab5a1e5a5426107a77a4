The decision could plunge thousands of residents living in the region into darkness. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom is planning to disconnect supply to West Rand Power Distributors, saying that the company owed it more than R18 million. The cash-strapped power utility said that it had notified the company of its intention to cut supply last month but received no favourable response. A deadline for submissions from all parties affected had been set for Friday. Eskom said that a failure to meet this deadline could lead to cutting off electricity from 20 February. The decision could plunge thousands of residents living in the region into darkness. West Rand Power Distributors were not available for comment.
