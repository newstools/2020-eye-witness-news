Coach Rito Hlungwani believes the Stormers are capable of doing a good job; insisting the team have a good pack and good exciting backline players. CAPE TOWN - Stormers forwards coach Rito Hlungwani said the team would match the Hurricanes running strength when the two teams meet in the opening match of the Super Rugby campaign this Saturday at Newlands. Hlungwani believes the Stormers are capable of doing a good job; insisting the team have a good pack and good exciting backline players. The Cape franchise announced late last year that former Western Province lock has joined the team as the new Stormers forwards coach. Hlungwani is confident the 'Canes' - as they are known by the fans - will focus on their strengths as their game plan. "The boys have been focused, the mental approach has been pretty good and they are in good space," said Hlungwani. "I think historically, the Hurricanes have been a running team - they have a lot of speed, I think that's where they'll try to come and impose us. We have to play at our strength, we've got a really good pack at the same time we've got really good exciting backline players. Like they say in the olden days - the forwards have to do the work. In terms of strategy, we want to play into our strength, use our break and see how far it can take it."
