CAPE TOWN - Cheetahs have named its team to face the Southern Kings in the PRO14  clash in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. The two sides have had six previous PRO14 encounters, with the Cheetahs victorious on each occasion. Joseph Dweba and Wilmar Arnoldi switch places, with Dweba in the starting line-up. Gerhard Olivier is the number eight, with Aidon Davids providing cover on the bench. Tian Schoeman returns to flyhalf. The wings are Anthony Volmink and Clayton Blommetjies with Chris Smit amongst the replacements. “I told the players that the previous three games in Port Elizabeth were close. The scores were 29-20, 21-20 and 24-17. That is what we will encounter, it won’t be a 60-20 scoreline,” said coach Hawies Fourie “If we don’t pitch up and play well, then we will be in the same boat as against Zebre. We have worked hard and mentally we know where we are. We know the mistakes we made against Zebre and we will put up a better performance. “My feeling is the game against the Cheetahs is the one the Kings are looking forward to for the entire season. If they beat us they will feel they are the best PRO14 side in South Africa. They’ve improved quite a lot since the start of the competition. We don’t underestimate them, but if they do underestimate us then it is okay, I will take that.” Cheetahs: 15. Rhyno Smith, 14. Clayton Blommetjies, 13. William Small-Smith, 12.
