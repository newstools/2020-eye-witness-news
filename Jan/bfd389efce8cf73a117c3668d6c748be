In a leaked audio recording last year, Mokgalapa could be heard telling former MMC Sheila Senkubuge negative comments about the metro’s council Speaker Katlego Mathebe. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA)’s federal council chair Helen Zille on Monday said Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa would now face a disciplinary hearing for the remarks he made about his colleagues. This was decided on at the party’s federal executive meeting at the weekend. In a leaked audio recording last year, Mokgalapa could be heard telling former MMC Sheila Senkubuge negative comments about the metro’s council Speaker Katlego Mathebe. The two were also said to be having an affair. Zille said the federal legal commission hasn’t been able to establish conclusively if Mokgalapa had sexual relations with Senkubuge at the municipal office as it’s alleged. But she said Mokgalapa would face a disciplinary hearing for calling Mathebe a witch and making other disparaging comments about some of his colleagues. Zille met with councillors in Tshwane on Monday to inform them of the decision.
