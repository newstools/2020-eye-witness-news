Gauteng Cooperative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile said he would explain at a briefing on Tuesday as to why he decided to suspend the pair and what led to his change of heart. JOHANNESBURG - While the Gauteng government has set aside its decision to suspend two Democratic Alliance (DA) councillors, the official opposition is going ahead with its legal action. Tshwane Speaker Katlego Mathebe and former Johannesburg Speaker Vasco da Dama are now considering bringing a civil suit against Cooperative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile for reputational damage. Maile rescinded his decision to suspend the pair on Monday. When Maile suspended the two councillors last week, he was upbeat, even calling them constitutional delinquents. “We have suspended them because they have breached the code of conduct as councillors, they are indisciplined and also undermined our constitution and the laws.” On the advice of lawyers, he’s now reinstated Mathebe and Da Gama. The DA’s Mike Moriarty said it was quite clear who the constitutional delinquent was here. “We think Maile should face consequences. So in this regard, councillors Mathebe and Da Gama are seeking legal advice against Lebogang Maile for impugning their integrity.” Maile said he would explain at a briefing on Tuesday as to why he decided to suspend the pair and what led to his change of heart.
