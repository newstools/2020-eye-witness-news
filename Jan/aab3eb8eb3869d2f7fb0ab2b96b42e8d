According to police, the shooting took place just after 01:00 on New Year's day at Poppy’s Restaurant on the corner of 2nd Avenue and 7th Avenue in Melville. "It is reported that a BMW SUV approached from 7th Avenue and suddenly, multiple shots were allegedly fired from the BMW at patrons who were sitting outside the restaurant.

Shop owners in Melville have expressed shock after the shooting outside Poppy’s Restaurant in the early hours of Wednesday morning. One shop owner has been operating in Melville for more than ten years now and said he had never seen anything like this before. “Now I’m scared. This is a scary life now.” Another man who runs a restaurant in the area said they had complained numerous times about noise coming from Poppy’s. “This is pretty much what happens in Melville in certain places. They operate as restaurants, but they don’t have entertainment licences and they have loud DJs up until 2 or 3 in the morning.” 《Melville》#RV14, #RV10, #A23 and #A09 attended to a mass shooting in Melville.
