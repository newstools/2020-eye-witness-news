Gauteng Cooperative MEC Lebogang Maile announced the suspensions on Thursday during a press briefing.

The MEC described Da Gama as a constitutional delinquent over his decision last year to postpone the vote for a new Johannesburg mayor. “We have decided to suspend the former (Johannesburg) speaker as a councillor for a period of three months without pay from today. We served him with that letter. This sanction has been used to send a strong message that nobody should ever play politics to the detriment of our residents.” Maile said officials should be held accountable for what he calls “despicable actions”. “It is our carefully considered view that the speaker placed her personal interests, to remain the speaker by any means necessary, above the needs of residents.” Maile said the decision to suspend Da Gama and Mathebe was consistent with the law and did not favour any political party.

Meanwhile, the DA said it would take the MEC to court for political harassment following the suspension its councillors.
