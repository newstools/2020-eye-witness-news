CAPE TOWN - A man is appearing in the Centane Magistrates Court on Monday for the alleged rape of an elderly woman. The 68-year-old victim was asleep at her home on Thursday when the suspect knocked on her door, pretending to be someone else. The police's Jackson Manatha: "When the victim did not open the door, he then kicked the door open, went straight to where the old lady was. She tried to use a stick to fight back but she was unfortunately over-powered by this man, who raped her." The woman managed to identify her alleged perpetrator and he was apprehended on Saturday.
