No injuries were reported. CAPE TOWN - Four classrooms at Groendal Secondary School in Franschhoek have been destroyed in a fire. Western Cape Education Department (WCED) officials said the blaze broke out at the school’s design and engineering classrooms at the end of the school day on Monday. No injuries were reported. The WCED spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said the cause of the blaze was under investigation. “The school is having a scheduled sports day today and learners will not be utilising the building. Instances like this are of course concerning from a safety perspective, but also frustrating when we are already challenged with space at schools and now we have lost four classrooms,” Hammond said.
