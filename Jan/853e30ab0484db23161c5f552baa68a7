Goals from Leonardo Castro, Samir Nurkovic, and Eric Mathoho saw Absa Premiership log leaders Amakhosi stretching their lead to nine points sinking the Citizens with just one point above the relegation zone. CAPE TOWN - Cape Town City FC coach Jan Olde Riekerink believes his team will bounce back following their 3-0 loss to Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Sunday. Goals from Leonardo Castro, Samir Nurkovic, and Eric Mathoho saw Absa Premiership log leaders Amakhosi stretching their lead to nine points at the top of the standings and left the Citizens just one point above the relegation zone in 13th. City were playing their third match this year having won one, drawn one and a loss and coach Riekerink believes the team is capable of scoring goals that could take them away from the relegation zone. "First loss this year and we had one win, one draw, and for me, football is how you play - but of course at the end, you have to score some goals and I have a trust in my team will do it," said Riekerink. "I'm more disappointed in the opportunities we got that we didn't score in them because the second goal came from our mistake - we tried to put more pressure in the second half and as you could see we were more compact in the middle". "I think we gave six or seven crosses, we don't have the striker in front of the goal - we have quick players, we have skillful players. Especially, the last part of the second half for us the big opportunities for us, our quality was to try and get a goal". City will welcome high-flying Bidvest Wits at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday.
