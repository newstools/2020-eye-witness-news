NEW YORK - The FBI is on the scene of the deadly helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, that’s claimed the life of NBA superstar Kobe Bryant, his daughter and seven others. The chopper went down in foggy weather on Sunday night, about 65 kilometres northwest of central Los Angeles. His death has stunned fans around the world and has sent shockwaves through the NBA, which he helped propel to global prominence. The Staples Center, home to where Bryant played so many games of his 20-year career with the LA Lakers, became a site of mourning as fans gathered outside it, ahead of Sunday night’s Grammy Awards. The ceremony, hosted by Alicia Keys, took on a sombre mood as artists including Keys paid tribute to Bryant’s legendary life. He was the youngest person to play in the NBA, a five-time NBA champ and a gold Olympic medallist who was pursuing another career in the film world as a producer.
