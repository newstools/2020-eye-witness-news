The charge relates to Rabada’s actions following the dismissal of Joe Root. JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s Kagiso Rabada has been fined 15% of his match fee and has also received one demerit point after being found guilty of a Level 1 breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel. The South African bowler was found to have violated Article 2.5 of the code during the first day of the 3rd Test match against England in Port Elizabeth on Thursday; it relates to “using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batter upon his or her dismissal during an international match”. The charge relates to Rabada’s actions following the dismissal of Joe Root. After the day’s play, Rabada admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Andy Pycroft of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees and, as such, there was no need for a formal hearing. Rabada has now accumulated four demerit points in a 24 month period and as such will miss South Africa’s next Test match. The charge was levelled by on-field umpires Rod Tucker and Bruce Oxenford and third umpire Joel Wilson as well as fourth umpire Allahudien Paleker. Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50% of a player’s match fee, and one or two demerit points.
