The motion was passed with 22 votes out of 25. There was just one abstention. CAPE TOWN/JOHANNESBURG – The Democratic Alliance (DA) is ready to remove its George Mayor Melvin Naik after passing a no-confidence motion against him. The DA's George caucus voted to remove Naik from his position on Tuesday. Councillors will now move an official motion in council to unseat him. The DA's caucus in George unanimously voted to remove  Naik. The motion was passed with 22 votes out of 25. There was just one abstention. The majority vote against Naik is a clear sign that he has lost all the support he had in the DA. If Naik refuses to leave his position, the DA could possible expel him as a member of the party. Meanwhile, in Gauteng, DA federal council chair Helen Zille said the party would try to conclude Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa’s disciplinary hearing as soon as possible to bring an end to the uncertainty in the capital. Zille said Mokgalapa would face the hearing to answer for the remarks he made about his colleagues. In a leaked audio recording last year, Mokgalapa could be heard making disparaging comments about council speaker Katlego Mathebe while talking to former MMC Sheila Senkubuge. The mayor was also accused of having an affair with the MMC. Zille said while Mokgalapa would face a hearing for calling Mathebe a “witch” in that audio recording, there was no evidence to support claims that he and the MMC engaged in sexual intercourse at the municipal office. “Due process takes a long time. We are going about things as quickly as we can, given our systems and structures. It’s not the same thing as Jacob Zuma avoiding trial for 10 years.”
