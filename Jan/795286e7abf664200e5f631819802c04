DURBAN - The case against the four men accused of kidnapping a Durban businesswoman is expected to resume in the regional court on Tuesday. Sandra Munsamy was kidnapped in May last year and found six months later chained to a bed in a luxury house in Emalahleni. The accused were moved to Kokstad maximum security prison - the country’s only super-maximum security prison. Munsamy was allegedly kidnapped by a gang targeting rich families to extort money from them. It was alleged that shortly after she went missing, a ransom of R140 million was sought from her family. It was not clear if this money was ever paid to secure her release. The Hawks previously said Munsamy was found following multi-disciplinary operations between state security agencies. At Tuesday’s court appearance, Correctional Services officials are expected to explain why the men were moved from the  to Kokstad.
