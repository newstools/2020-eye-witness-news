While the police and paramedics were inside the patient’s home, the vehicle’s window was forced open and a cardiac monitor worth an estimated R300,000 was stolen. On Sunday, a female paramedic sustained an eye injury after a stone shattered the ambulance’s windscreen. The woman and her partner were in Ravensmead in the early hours of the morning to collect and transport a patient to Tygerberg Hospital.
