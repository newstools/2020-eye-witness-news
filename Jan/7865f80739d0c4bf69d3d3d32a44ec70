Enoch Mpianzi (13), a Parktown Boys' High learner, drowned during what has been described as a water activity in a river at a lodge while on a school camp on Wednesday. JOHANNESBURG – Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said that Enoch Mpianzi's parents said that their son was excited about the grade 8 Parktown Boys' High camp. Mpianzi (13) drowned during what has been described as a water activity in a river at a lodge on Wednesday. Lesufi briefed the media at the school on Friday to shed more light on what transpired. "I was not briefed on whether the people that assisted the children and the children themselves had life jackets or given a water safety talk, so that part of the information was not provided to me." The MEC said that the death would be investigated. #ParktownBoysCamp Lesufi: It seems what they were doing is an activity to try and move an injured person across the river. I asked them to take me through the same activity so I can understand. KM  #ParktownBoysCamp Lesufi: I don't doubt that the school wanted to make sure all children are safe. I doubt that they wanted the boy to drown. What is concerning is the timelines? KM  LAST RESPECTS Meanwhile, Mpianzi's parents have paid their last respects at the site where the drowning happened. Gauteng Education Panyaza Lesufi was with the parents during search and rescue operations. UPDATE 2: #ParktownBoysCamp .
