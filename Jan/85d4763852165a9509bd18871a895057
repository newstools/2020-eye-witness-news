In an unprecedented move, Judge President Patricia Goliath went public with her complaint against Judge president John Hlophe in a complaint to the Judicial Service Commission. CAPE TOWN - The Cape Bar has stepped into the public spat between the Western Cape’s top judges. Judge President John Hlophe is being accused of verbally victimising deputy Judge President Patricia Goliath. In an unprecedented move, Goliath went public with her complaint against Hlophe in a complaint to the Judicial Service Commission. She claimed Hlope tried to influence the appointment of judges in a 2015 case involving former President Jacob Zuma. It was one of several accusations against Hlophe in the formal complaint. In her 15-page submission, Goliath claimed Hlope verbally abused her over the space of a year. The Cape Bar requested urgent action be taken so that the matter could be addressed. In the circular note to its members, the Cape Bar council said it had written to Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. They wanted Mogoeng to urgently intervene in the matter as the Western Cape High Court’s reputation was at stake.
