JOHANNESBURG - Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has met with Telkom management to discuss the planned retrenchments of around 3,000 workers. On Wednesday, unions received section 189 notices which will affect workers in the open-serve and consumer divisions. Telkom’s Mooketsi Mocumi said management had met with Ndabeni-Abrahams to discuss the company’s planned retrenchments.  Mocumi said they had explained to Ndabeni-Abrahams that the weak economy and decline in fixed-line and fixed data revenues had a significant impact on the business. “We will keep the minister and other stakeholders updated. The meeting went well.” Ndabeni-Abrahams shared concerns about the planned cuts. Telkom has scheduled a meeting with union representatives at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) for next week to discuss the next step.
