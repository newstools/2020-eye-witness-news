Stormers will kick off the new Super Rugby campaign with the New Zealand outfit the Hurricanes at Newlands in two weeks. CAPE TOWN - Stormers captain Siya Kolisi has vowed to bring his Springboks winning leadership skills to Newlands ahead of the new Super Rugby season. Stormers will kick off the new Super Rugby campaign with the New Zealand outfit the Hurricanes at Newlands in two weeks. This was the last year for the union at Newlands, as they are moving to Cape Town Stadium in 2021. Financial difficulties have forced the Stormers to quit a venue they own and become anchor tenants at Cape Town Stadium, which was built for the 2010 Fifa World Cup. Kolisi says it will be an emotional year for the team and their fans. "Everything is going well. I'm still the same person I was last year, nothing has changed. But the difference this time is having more energy and confidence. I will try to work hard and give what I have learnt and brought back from the Springboks to the club and encourage them. What we want is to be able to do a transition; we want to be able to be in the playoffs or play final here at Newlands," said Kolisi. He added: "We don't want to think too much and far but to play and take it one day at the time. There are a lot of things to do in South Africa and a lot of people that need help. What I believe in and want to is help and give what I have back because I myself been to the position they are."
