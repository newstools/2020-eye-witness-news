US President Donald Trump continues to justify his order to kill the commander of Iran's Quds Force, General Qasem Soleimani, saying the assassination was in the interest of American safety. TEL AVIV - The United States is reportedly sending nearly 3,000 more army troops to the Middle East in the wake of its strike overnight Thursday that killed a top Iranian general. Tehran is vowing it will retaliate and has warned Washington that the strike was its "biggest strategic mistake." US President Donald Trump continues to justify his order to kill the commander of Iran's Quds Force, General Qasem Soleimani, saying the assassination was in the interest of American safety. But the dispatch of extra American troops to the Middle East shows that Washington is concerned about possible Iranian retaliation and also runs counter to Trump's repeated push to extract the United States from the region. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets yesterday to protest against what they said are Americans crimes. Chanting "Death to America" and holding up posters of the slain commander, the demonstrators filled streets for several blocks in central Tehran. Meanwhile, the Israeli military has gone on high amid fears that Iran could strike Israel through its regional allies such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, and Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza.
