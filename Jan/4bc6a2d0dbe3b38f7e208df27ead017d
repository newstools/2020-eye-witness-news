In the absence of local catalysts, the rand was set to look to global events for direction. JOHANNESBURG - The rand firmed in early trade on Tuesday as emerging markets drew relief from the absence of any immediate escalation in tensions other than sabre-rattling between Iran and the United States. By 0600 GMT, the rand traded at R14.1900 per dollar, 0.15% stronger than its previous close. In the absence of local catalysts, the rand was set to look to global events for direction. Fears of a fresh conflict in the oil-rich Middle East have kept markets on the edge following the killing of Tehranâ€™s top general in a US drone strike last week. In fixed income, the yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 was down 2.5 basis points to 8.225% in early trade.
