The gloves are off: the Western Cape's top judges are fighting each other, and they've decided to do it publicly. CAPE TOWN - A public spat between the Western Cape’s top judges continues as High Court judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe claims it’s part of a ploy to take over the top job. She was responding to a complaint by deputy judge president Patricia Goliath against herself and her husband judge president John Hlophe. Salie-Hlophe has hit back at Goliath in a scathing four-page rebuke, saying the complaint was simply a bitter spew to oust the judge president. She said Goliath had an unhealthy obsession with her marriage and that she had tried to dissuade her from marrying judge Hlophe. Salie-Hlophe also said it was a completely fabricated, wrongful and unlawful claim that she was involved in the administration and management of the division. Goliath compiled a 15-page complaint ranging from everything around verbal abuse to intimidation and unfair treatment by judge Hlophe. The Judicial Service Commission is investigating the matter, but until then, it will be a tense few months ahead in the Western Cape High Court.
