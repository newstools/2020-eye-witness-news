CAPE TOWN - Motorists in the Western Cape can expect a slight drop in the price of 95 octane petrol based on current data. That's the calculation of the Automobile Association. The AA's Layton Beard has the details. "Based on the current data, 95 octane petrol is expected to drop by 8c per litre but 93 octane petrol is expected to increase by 1c, diesel by 13c and illuminating paraffin by 10c." Beard explained what's causing most grades to rise in price. "The big driver behind this is the increased international oil prices as well as a weakening rand. It couldn't come at a worse time as South Africans are already feeling the financial pinch and this is going to add to their woes."
