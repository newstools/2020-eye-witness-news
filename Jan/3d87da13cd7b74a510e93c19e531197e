Maile has rescinded the suspensions of Tshwane speaker Katleho Mathebe and former Johannesburg speaker Vasco Da Gama. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) said it couldn’t wait to hear Cooperative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile’s explanation following his decision to reinstate the party’s councillors. Maile has rescinded the suspensions of Tshwane speaker Katleho Mathebe and former Johannesburg speaker Vasco da Gama. The pair were suspended last week without pay with the MEC accusing them of being constitutional delinquents and abusing their power. Maile is expected to explain why he suspended DA councillors only to reverse that decision four days later. The party's Mike Moriarty said Maile came to his senses. “He did several things wrong in an exercise to grab power in Tshwane. He didn’t follow the procedures set down in the act when dealing with the conduct of councillors and didn’t observe due process.” But Maile’s reinstatement of the councillors hasn't won over the DA. The party is considering a civil suit against the MEC for reputational damage and it wants Gauteng Premier David Makhura to fire him. Moriarty said Maile took advantage of the instability in Tshwane and that his decision to rescind the suspensions of Mathebe and Da Gama was proof. He believes Maile must be removed from office. “The DA will set a motion in the Gauteng legislature, calling upon Makhura to remove Maile as the MEC.”
