Jamie Roberts joined the Stormers for the new Super Rugby season and will play a major role in nurturing the talent around him. CAPE TOWN - Wales and British and Irish Lions legend Jamie Roberts says he can't wait to settle in with his new side and help the Stormers to achieve their goals. Roberts joined the Stormers for the new Super Rugby season and will play a major role in nurturing the talent around him. He says being in Cape Town and joining the team was an opportunity he couldn't refuse. The experienced centre joined up with his new teammates this week, ahead of the first game of the 2020 campaign against the Hurricanes at Newlands on Saturday, 1 February. The 33-year-old Roberts says that being at Newlands feels like being part of the history of the stadium and wants to win Super Rugby with the Cape-based side. "It feels like a real rugby ground - I was travelling around and saw the terrace around the stadium, its a special place, I guess coming here immediately you feel like you are part of the history," said Roberts. "I want to win Super Rugby that is why I came here - I want to play for the team and contribute and bring much strength to the team. John [Dobson] has seen something in me, that is why he brought me here." Roberts says coming to play in the Southern Hemisphere wasn't about the money. "You always try to find lucrative. To me lucrative is about rugby experience it's not about money," he said. "South Africa for me... having toured this country ten times in my career - every time I tour here it's the best time of my experience." The centre amassed a total of 97 Test caps for Wales and the British and Irish Lions over an illustrious career.
