JOHANNESBURG - The South African Weather Service (SAWS) on Sunday said South Africans should expect more stormy weather across the country in the coming days bringing in some much-needed relief for drought-stricken areas. A watch was issued for heavy rains and possible flooding in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Free State. SAWS forecaster Edward Engelbrecht said: “We have a watch issued for severe thunderstorms that are expected over the southern parts of the Free State, south-western parts of KZN, as well as the north-eastern parts of the Eastern Cape but that’s mainly going to be from the afternoon and continuing into the evening.” The Free State was hit by a severe drought which led to a water crisis in Qwaqwa. Residents in the area took to the streets demanding a solution to the problem.
