JOHANNESBURG - Professor Malegapuru Makgoba has been appointed as the Eskom board's interim chairperson. This comes after Jabu Mabuza's resignation last week, in which he apologised for the power utility's inability to meet the commitment it made to President Cyril Ramaphosa in December to avoid load shedding during the holiday period. Makgoba joined Eskom's board as a non-executive director in 2018 and the Public Enterprises Department believes his appointment as interim chair is consistent with government's commitment to good governance and the stability of the company. Public Enterprises spokesperson Sam Mkokeli: "This is an urgent process but the government wants to make sure that the legal and administrative processes are followed. President Ramaphosa announced last week that the board would be reconfigured. The governemnt has in mind people with the appropriate mix of experience." Meanwhile, ANC stalwarts and veterans have thrown their weight behind Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan amid growing calls for him to step down due to the crisis at Eskom. They said that the power utility had problems before Gordhan was appointed to the department and that blaming him was disingenuous.
