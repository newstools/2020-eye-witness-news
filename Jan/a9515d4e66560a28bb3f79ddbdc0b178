US-Iran relations are now on shaky ground after US President Donald Trump authorised a drone strike which killed Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad on Thursday. JOHANNESBURG - International relations minister Dr Naledi Pandor is calling for cool heads in the heat of Middle East tensions sparked by the killing of a top Iranian commander. US-Iran relations are now on shaky ground after US President Donald Trump authorised a drone strike which killed Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad on Thursday. In light of Iran's threat to retaliate to the US, Iraq - which is seemingly caught in the middle of the row - is bracing itself for the worst and says armed groups are ready to protect the country. Pandor said the latest developments not only have far-reaching ramifications for the Middle East, but also for international peace and security. The minister said it's crucial that all sides remain calm and desist from taking any further action that will exacerbate an already fragile situation.
