Gauteng Local Government Minister Lebogang Maile suspended Mathebe for six months without pay and Johannesburg councillors Vasco da Gama for three months. JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress (ANC) in Tshwane says now that the speaker of council in the capital Katlego Mathebe has been suspended, the party will put forward a nomination for someone to act in the process. Gauteng Local Government Minister Lebogang Maile suspended Mathebe for six months  without pay and Johannesburg councillors Vasco da Gama for three months. The MEC says they are constitutional delinquents and acted contrary to their responsibilities when they collapsed council meetings. ANC Tshwane chairperson Kgosi Maepa said, “Remember this is a continuation meeting, so it’s not a new meeting. It’s a simple continuation of a meeting that the speaker collapsed, that’s why she was suspended. So we will continue with all those four motions and we will vote on them, that’s it.” Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance (DA) is threating legal action against the suspension of the two councillors. The party's Bones Modise said they deliberately put the interests of the DA before those of the residents of the two municipalities. “Both councillors decided to put their narrow political interest before the people of the City of Johannesburg and the City of Tshwane. MEC Maile exercised his responsibility as enshrined in the Constitution. Therefore, that cannot be considered a bullying tactic.”
