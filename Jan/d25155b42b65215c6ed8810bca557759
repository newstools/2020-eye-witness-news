Duminy on Monday announced his official retirement from all cricket. CAPE TOWN - Former Proteas batsman JP Duminy said that a number of things had made him call time on his cricket career. Duminy on Monday announced his official retirement from all cricket. The 35-year-old, who made 46 Test appearances for South Africa retired from international cricket after the conclusion of the 2019 World Cup but continued playing domestic cricket. Duminy played in the Indian Premier League, he also played in the Pakistan Super League in 2018 before playing in the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament. After getting injured in the 2019 Mzansi Super League tournament, he stayed on with the Paarl Rocks team for the duration of the tournament in a mentorship role. He said that a lot of things made him retire and his passion was now directed towards the development and helping the next generation. "A couple of things - first and foremost a demand on my body, I think it was becoming quite tough due to injuries and also the hunger and desire of the process of the retirement. Once international cricket was done six months ago, you kind of really have to find a purpose for playing," said Duminy. "When you play for your country there's always a higher purpose... when you play around the world in T20 leagues... not that there's no purpose behind it I mean there's always pride and performance. "There's always a value-add to a team, there are ways of adding value to other people's careers, so I did find a purpose in that. "I got to a point in my life where I thought I'm ready to take the... unknown road if you want to call it that. Because my passion lies in the development, in helping the next generation... just to try and grow platforms for that to happen." Duminy played 196 one-day internationals and 80 T20s for South Africa.
