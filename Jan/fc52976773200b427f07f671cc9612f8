ANC NEC lekgotla brings together government leaders including director generals and ministers, where they will discuss a programme of action for the year. JOHANNESBURG – The two-day African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee(NEC) lekgotla will kick-off in Irene on Sunday. The lekgotla brings together ANC leaders in government and comes after the party's NEC meeting. The last two days saw committee members discussing, among other things, expropriation of land without compensation and the state of government entities in line with President Cyril Ramaphosa's directive during his January 8 statement. There have been calls from Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and its affiliates on the President to fire Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan  over continued power cuts, with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) threatening to disrupt His State of Nation Address – should the president fail to axe the minister. During his speech in Kimberley last week, Ramphosa said land reform would take centre stage adding that the return of the land to its rightful owners will promote economic growth. Sunday's ANC NEC lekgotla brings together government leaders including director generals and ministers, where they will discuss a programme of action for the year. Political analyst Sanusha Naidu says members at the lekgotla have no choice but to discuss certain pressing issues. “I think they have a whole lot to discuss from economic transformation and reform, the state of the SOEs (state-owned enterprises), to the nature of where we are going as a country and ‘what is the road map?’ because inevitably, it’s not working out.” Details of the meeting will be released in due cause.
