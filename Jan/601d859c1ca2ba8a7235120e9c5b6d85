Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate says she noticed she had been cut out the picture where she appeared alongside her four white peers. JOHANNESBURG – Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate has called out racism in media after she was cropped out of a photo featuring prominent climate activists, including Greta Thunberg. Nakate says she was invited to attend a youth climate science event in Davos and when news coverage of the event emerged, she noticed she had been cut out the picture where she appeared alongside her four white peers. She posted a video online in tears of her displeasure calling out the discrimination. “This is the first time in my life that I understood the definition of the word ‘racism’. They have the guts to change the photo without even giving an explanation or apology. Does that mean that I have no value as an African activist?”
