Karabo Tau allegedly abducted two-month-old Kwahlelo Tiwane in Parow earlier this month. CAPE TOWN – A youth accused of kidnapping a baby said she would prove her innocence. Karabo Tau returned to the Bellville Magistrates Court on Monday. She allegedly abducted two-month-old Kwahlelo Tiwane in Parow earlier this month. It’s believed Tau posed as a social worker before snatching the baby. The court heard Tau was at school at the time the two-month-old baby boy was abducted. Tau’s defence said CCTV footage would prove this. Written testimony from a teacher also supports the claim that she was in a Xhosa class at the time of the crime. A second suspect was arrested and appeared alongside Tau on Monday. His bail application will be heard on 3 February. Meanwhile, Tau’s bail bid resumes on Tuesday afternoon.
