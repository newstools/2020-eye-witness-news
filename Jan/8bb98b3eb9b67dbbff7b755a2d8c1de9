Maharaj left the parastatal in 2017 to do work at an energy company in the Philippines. JOHANNESBURG - A former Eskom senior project manager has returned to the utility to take over the management of the Kusile project. Avin Maharaj left the parastatal in 2017 to do work at an energy company in the Philippines. Maharaj returns to the cash-strapped state-owned entity after it failed to fill the vacancy through an internal appointment. Eskom’s Dikatso Mothae explained: “He has the experience and has project management experience. We believe he’ll help us get Kusile to completion.” Last month, the Hawks arrested two former senior managers for fraud, corruption and money laundering at the Kusile power station amounting to R745 million.
