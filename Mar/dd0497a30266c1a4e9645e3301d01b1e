JOHANNESBURG - Justice Minister Ronald Lamola said that the recently passed regulations on COVID-19 were subject to constant review. Lamola said that currently all visits to Correctional Services facilities had been suspended until April to limit the possible transmission of the coronavirus. Lamola and his Police Minister counterpart Bheki Cele had outlined how they would enforce the laws passed to deal with the pandemic. Prisons are infamous for being overcrowded and to ward off the spread of the virus, Lamola said that all visits had been suspended until 15 April. "The Department of Correctional Services has not yet recorded any positive cases of COVID-19 across all its centres in the country thus far. We will continue with preventative measures which are aimed at combatting the virus." The minister said that they also needed more legal practitioners to prosecute culprits who may break these rules. "This is an integrated approach from police, NPA and Correctional Services, including the presiding officers." Lamola said that as the numbers of confirmed cases increased, these regulations may become even more strict.
