Norman Mapeza was quickly replaced by former Orlando Pirates assistant coach Rhulani Mokwena after the Port Elizabeth based club announced it on Wednesday. CAPE TOWN - The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality has warned Chippa United over its management style following the sudden resignation of head coach Norman Mapeza this week. The municipality is the side's main sponsor. Mapeza was quickly replaced by former Orlando Pirates assistant coach Rhulani Mokwena after the Port Elizabeth based club announced it on Wednesday. Chippa United have been known as the 'chop and change' - 'hire and fire' team in the Absa Premiership in the department of coaches. The municipality's acting executive Mayor Marlon Daniels warned the Chilli Boys that they must shape up. The statement reads: "On behalf of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, I would like to express our serious concern about the recent resignation of Chippa United's Norman Mapeza. Over the past two seasons, we have seen the team frequently changing coaches and senior managers. It was Dan Malesela, Eric Tinkler, Joel Masutha, Clinton Larsen, Duran Francis, now Norman Mapeza, whom we are told decided to resign. What worries us most, is the fact that all these changes or firing of coaches and managers have been characterised by lack of visionary leadership, a clumsy management style and an obvious lack of understanding of the business of football.‚Äù"We believe that this style of management is the reason why the team has found itself fighting for relegation every season, including the current season. As the main sponsor of the team and a partner who really has the best interest of the team at heart, we call upon the management of Chippa United to shape up. Our City has invested a lot of ratepayers money in this team. This team carries the dreams and aspirations of young footballers of our City and Province. If things continue like this, we might not be lucky this time to survive the relegation axe."
