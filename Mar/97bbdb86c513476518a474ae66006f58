Managers of places that will sell liquor beyond the designated hours will be charged. JOHANNESBURG - The ministries of Police and Tourism said gatherings that don’t adhere to coronavirus regulations will be dispersed and owners of establishments will be charged. The two ministries have clarified the regulations following numerous public inquiries. Police ministry spokesperson Mathapelo Peters said no more than 100 people shall be allowed to gather at any point at any time and failure to adhere to this restriction could see police order the immediate dispersal of the gathering - or fine and arrest the organizer. She said restaurants, hotels and grocery stores with licenses to sell liquor, must stop selling liquor as per the time restrictions but may operate beyond those hours to sell and/or serve food with absolutely no liquor. Managers of places that will sell liquor beyond the designated hours will be charged. “The condition with staying open after the 18h00 and 13h00 deadline is that the people on the premises must be 50 or less, including the staff,” Peters said.
