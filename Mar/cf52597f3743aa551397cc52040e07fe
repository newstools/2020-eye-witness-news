South Africa have already qualified automatically for the 2022 Women's T20 World Cup. CAPE TOWN - The International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced that South Africa will host the Women's T20 World Cup in 2022. South Africa have already qualified automatically for the 2022 Women's T20 World Cup. The ICC confirmed the news on their social media platform on Tuesday.  The news came just in time with South Africa competing at the 2020 Womenâ€™s T20 World Cup in Australia. The Proteas Women have finished top of their group for the first time in the history of an ICC event after their final pool match of the Women's T20 World Cup against West Indies was abandoned without a ball being bowled in Sydney on Tuesday. The result, and point gained from the washout, means South Africa finished on seven points, one ahead of England, with both having already qualified for the sem-finals even before the last day of round-robin fixtures were scheduled to begin. The semifinal line up sees India play England while SA plays Australia. Both games take place on Thursday.
