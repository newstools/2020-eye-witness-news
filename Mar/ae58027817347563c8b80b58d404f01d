Stage one was suspended at 5 pm, but Eskom said it would have to turn off your electricity again later on Tuesday morning because the power system remains vulnerable and unpredictable. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom will be ramping up load shedding to stage 2 at 9 am on Tuesday. Stage 1 was suspended at 5 pm on Monday, but Eskom said it would have to turn off your electricity again later on Tuesday morning because the power system remained vulnerable and unpredictable. The parastatal is blaming breakdowns at its ageing power stations for a shortage in capacity. Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said the power cuts were likely to continue for the rest of the week. “It is most likely that we will continue with load shedding for the rest of the week and this is because some generation units we had expected would return to service today have been delayed further and we expect to get out of this bind by the end of the week," he said. Eskom said it was expecting more units to come back online on Tuesday afternoon. The utility has once again warned that the situation could change at short notice. The rolling blackouts are expected to last until the end of the week. Mantshantsha said: “The outlook is better but of course, the situation may change at short notice, either for the better or for worse, for the same reasons we have always been stating and that is the unreliability and unpredictability of the units.” _Click here to check for your load shedding schedule. _
