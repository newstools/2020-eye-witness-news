Santaco president Phillip Taaibosch said they would be meeting with business partners on Thursday where a message would be communicated on how to be more cautious on the job. JOHANNESBURG - Taxi governing body Santaco is now working on a plan to put stringent hygiene measures in place for drivers and millions of commuters at taxi ranks as well as inside the vehicles they travel in. President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on people to avoid using taxis and busses where possible to limit possible exposure to coronavirus. He announced a state of disaster on Sunday night, which involved the closure of schools, travel restrictions and the scrapping of mass gatherings involving crowds of more than 100 people. Many have been asking what this means for those who rely on taxis to get around. Santaco president Phillip Taaibosch said they would be meeting with business partners on Thursday where a message would be communicated on how to be more cautious on the job. “Remember we are still dealing with hawkers, queue marshals and all those people and we need to make sure the message goes to them and to the broader public.” Meanwhile, government has increased its programmes to inform the public how they should respond and keep themselves safe. One such initiative is a video, which has been posted by the Department of International Relations on its social media platform.
