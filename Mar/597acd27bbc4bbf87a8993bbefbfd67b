Cecilia Molokwane believes athletes must take necessary precautions against the virus and abide by the rules of the country of this pandemic disease. CAPE TOWN - Netball South Africa (NSA) president Cecilia Molokwane said the coronavirus would impact badly on sport, however, the health of people in the country came first. Molokwane believed that athletes must take the necessary precautions against the virus and abide by the rules of the country in the face of the coronavirus outbreak. On Monday, Molokwane and her executive members took a unanimous decision to suspend all planned netball activities scheduled to take place in March and April 2020 effective immediately. The affected events included the 2020 Telkom Netball League media launch and the under-21 national training camp. She said national team players who were currently playing in Australia and England were in self-isolation. "They [overseas players] said they are safe wherever they are. They said we mustn't worry and they've been kept safe, so we need to take their word because they are overseas, not here. We believe whatever they've told us and their clubs told us... it's the right way," said Molokwane. "The virus will impact badly on sport, however, the health of people in the country comes first, we need to abide by the rules and regulations of the country - the president has spoken - in netball we are saying we are suspending everything until further notice. "We know that the health of our players is very important because we need them well and healthy when they come back and we will assess the situation like everybody else."
