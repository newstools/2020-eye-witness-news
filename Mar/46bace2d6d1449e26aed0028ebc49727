"I do understand that this won’t be sufficient… the sector has almost come to a standstill with various categories of businesses affected." Kubayi-Ngubane said that bigger companies would be able to get help through broader government assistance as well as through tax relief and loan repayment holidays. "We are looking at the smaller businesses that are likely not to survive." Companies will have to show their businesses have been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. "We will ask for information that shows the business is in distress because of COVID-19. It shouldn’t be somebody who’s already been battling before COVID-19 started."
