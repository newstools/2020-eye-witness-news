WATCH: South Africa’s coronavirus interventions  PANIC BUYING Many grocery shops were overrun on Monday by consumers panic buying and stock-piling items. Videos on social media show long snaking queues with scores of people standing in close quarters. South Africans have been urged to be rational when shopping for supplies as so-called panic-buying spikes. The dean of the Gordon Institute of Business Science Nicola Kleyn said this could also be referred to as rational disaster buying. “It’s entirely rationale if people think they won’t have access to those things for a period. People want to go home and have a feeling of I’ve done what I need to do so I don’t need to go out anymore.” To track the latest developments around the coronavirus both in South Africa and abroad, click on this live status report from Strategix.
