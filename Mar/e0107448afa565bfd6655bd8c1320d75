CAPE TOWN - Kaizer Chiefs have announced that the contract talks between the club and midfielder George Maluleka have reached an unexpected end. Chiefs had offered the 31-year-old a two-year contract extension and one-year option to renew on his current contract, but he turned it down. "Following a string of negotiations, the player himself revealed to the club that he has signed a pre-contract with Mamelodi Sundowns," said the club. "Notably, Mamelodi Sundowns have not informed Chiefs about their engagements with George Maluleka as protocol dictates." Maluleka joined Kaizer Chiefs in January 2014 and his current contract was due to end on 30 June 2020.
