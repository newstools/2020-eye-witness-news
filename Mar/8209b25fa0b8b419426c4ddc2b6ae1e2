DURBAN - The owner of a Durban butchery has been arrested after he was allegedly found to be using the coronavirus (COVID-19)  outbreak to sell much-needed food and products at inflated prices. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs Nomusa Dube-Ncube said the suspect had admitted to inflating prices. Dube-Ncube said if the owner was found guilty he would be liable to pay up to a R1 million fine or up to 10% of his businessâ€™s annual turnover. In addition, there was also a possibility of imprisonment of up to one year. The Phoenix-based butchery owner was arrested on Wednesday. Since then, officials have looked into allegations of price-hiking by other major outlets. Dube-Ncube said the National Consumer Commission and the Competition Commission were investigating.
