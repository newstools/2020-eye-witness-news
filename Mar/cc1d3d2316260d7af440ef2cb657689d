Reagan Gertse was found dead last weekend. Police have arrested a parolee who lives two doors away from the deceased's family and is a distant relative. Mourners will gather at the Old Apostolic Church in the Cape Winelands community of Tulbagh on Saturday morning to bid a final farewell to Gertse. The 7-year-old boy's body was found on the banks of a river on Sunday - just hours after he was reported missing. The accused - 58-year-old Jakobus Petoors - is the victim's step-grandfather's brother - and lives only two doors away from the slain child's family. Petoors - who was released on parole in November - has been charged with Gertse's rape and murder. The suspect appeared in court earlier this week and the matter was postponed to early June for further investigation.
