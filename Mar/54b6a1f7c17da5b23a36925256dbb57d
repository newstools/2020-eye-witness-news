We felt a bit tired like we had colds, and some body aches. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and were found to be positive," he said. "We will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. We'll keep the world posted and updated," he added, along with a photo of a surgical glove placed inside a biohazard trash bag.
