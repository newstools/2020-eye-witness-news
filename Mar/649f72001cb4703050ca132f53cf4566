Provincial Social Development MEC Sharna Fernandez said that this initiative would go a long way in ensuring the safety of women and kids who had been abused. "I think the issue of safe houses has always been... the fact that we've never had enough and that every place we've identified on exactly those areas that we've been focusing on." Fernandez said that in 2019, more than 4,600 women were reported to have been raped in the Western Cape, of which 205 were aged up to 9-years-old.
