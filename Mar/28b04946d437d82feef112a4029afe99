The president has called on South Africans to unite behind the recently imposed restrictions, while the SAHRC says the outbreak is a test on government’s readiness to address healthcare issues. JOHANNESBURG – As South Africa marks Human Rights Day, President Cyril Ramaphosa is calling on the country to unite behind the recently introduced coronavirus interventions aimed at curbing the pandemic. The president made the call through a statement a short while ago, as the official commemoration of Human Rights Day had to be put on hold due to restrictions on gatherings of more than 100 people. Ramaphosa introduced a raft of interventions a week ago under the Disaster Management Act. These include a ban on the gathering of more than 100 people, the closure of schools and the suspension of flights to nations hardest hit by the coronavirus. At the same time, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) said the outbreak of COVID -19 in the country will test the government's ability to implement the national health insurance. The country's infections keep rising with 240 people cases so far. The majority of the country’s confirmed cases are in Gauteng, followed by the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. So far, no one has died. The commission said the spread of the coronavirus poses a serious challenge to government. The SAHRC’s Buang Jones says, “The advent of COVID-19 will test government’s readiness to implement the National Health Insurance. It will be crucial in addressing the two-tier healthcare system and the deep spatial inequalities in accessing healthcare.”
