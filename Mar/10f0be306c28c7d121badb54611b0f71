JOHANNESBURG- Gauteng Premier David Makhura  on Wednesday once again urged residents not to leave the province ahead of the 21-day lockdown as this may undermine government’s efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).

Also, we are worried about the people of Gauteng who go somewhere who may be infected [and] we are also worried about the people who might be coming back,” Makhura said. “We urge Gauteng residents not to go home to rural areas where they come from. For the next 21 days please stay at home because you might be taking the virus to the most vulnerable,” he added. Makhura said in order to stop the spread of coronavirus people should stay home. “I want to make a plea to many of us who would be otherwise travelling not to travel to different parts of our country and not to travel anywhere else but stay at home,” he said. The provincial government said if residents failed to comply with the lockdown rules, they would be putting the lives of thousands of people at risk.
