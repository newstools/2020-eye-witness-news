Seven people were killed and seven others, including a six-year-old girl, were wounded when gunmen stormed the drinking spot in the early hours of Sunday morning. CAPE TOWN - Police Minister Bheki Cele has condemned a massacre at a Khayelitsha tavern. Seven people were killed and seven others, including a six-year-old girl, were wounded when gunmen stormed the drinking spot in the early hours of Sunday morning. Police arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with the attack. Cele, on Tuesday, visited the crime scene in Site B in Khayelitsha. He labelled Sunday morning's massacre a heinous attack.  Cele has urged detectives to work around the clock to ensure that all suspects were apprehended as preliminary evidence suggested that there were several gunmen. The 32-year-old man already arrested was scheduled to appear in court today. Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz said in response to a written question in provincial legislature last month that the SAPS reported there had been 15 tavern shootings in the province over the past 24 months.
