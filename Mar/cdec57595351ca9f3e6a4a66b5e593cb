According to the nominations council, Aleck Skhosana failed to submit a form to confirm that he was a member in good standing despite being the president of Athletics in South Africa. JOHANNESBURG - Athletics South Africa (ASA) president Aleck Skhosanaâ€™s bid for the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) top job hit a snag after the Olympic body said he was ineligible for the race after failing to submit one document. According to the nominations council, he failed to submit a form to confirm that he was a member in good standing despite being the president of Athletics in South Africa. ASA lawyer, Dev Maharaj said that all five required documents were submitted and they were now waiting to hear back from Sascoc on what the next step was. "We are giving them until 16h00 Thursday afternoon to respond one way or the other, and should they fail to do so, unfortunately, we will raise a formal dispute and see an urgent arbitration in terms of the Sascoc resolution rules and mechanisms," he said. With the elections once again marred by controversy, Skhosana revealed that he had written to the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa to give direction ahead of the 28 March 2020 vote. "I have written to the minister - the letter has been received by those who work with the minister, they confirmed that they will brief him and there's nothing more I can say on that," said Skhosana. Skhosana also added that he believed he was being sabotaged in his quest to be president. He's running against acting president Barry Hendricks. "ASA submitted a letter - required documents, my ID and all the forms that had to be signed. I cannot assume further than that there are those who are hell-bent to stop me," he said. "I am unstoppable, unfortunately."
