CAPE TOWN - Two suspected arsonists are set to appear in court. The men aged 34- and 38-years-old were arrested after allegedly torching a train carriage at Eerste River Station early on Friday morning. A case of malicious damage to property was opened at Kleinvlei Police Station. The suspects are expected to appear in the Blue Downs magistrates court on Monday. Metrorail's Western Cape regional spokesperson, Riana Scott, said that Prasa officials were assessing the cost of damages to the infrastructure. "Due to the quick action of the train crew, the burning carriage was separated from the rest of the train and fire and rescue services could contain the fire quickly. We condemn the action in the strongest possible terms."
