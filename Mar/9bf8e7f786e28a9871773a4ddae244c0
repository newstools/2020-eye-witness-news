John Dobson side is approaching the match after winning four matches having played five and lost only just one to the New Zealand based side, the Blues. CAPE TOWN - The Stormers are bracing themselves for a tough task at hand when they visit the Sharks for the Super Rugby clash at Kings Parks Stadium on Saturday. Head coach John Dobson's side is approaching the match after winning four matches having played five and lost only just one to the New Zealand based side, the Blues. Dobson on Wednesday said a win against the Sharks would be vital in the conference. Both sides are first and second respectively in the South African conference with the Durban-based side leading on 20 points while the Cape side sitting on 17. Dobson admitted anything can change in Super Rugby but said he didn't want to panic. He said the team was looking at the option to bring Jean-Luc du Plessis at flyhalf and Damian Willemse at fullback. "It's an option - we're not completely broken so I don't want to panic in any form, it is an option that we are looking at. The problem with that is if we move Damian to fullback, we've got Dillyn Leyds who we think is the best fullback in this competition. So, I'm not sure its an option but we will look at it; Jean-Luc at flyhalf but we still looking at it."
