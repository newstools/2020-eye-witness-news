JOHANNESBURG - Power utility Eskom has said the likelihood of load shedding on Saturday had increased significantly following multiple generation unit trips. The power utility had earlier said there was no load shedding planned for the weekend, marking almost two weeks since the last rotational power cuts. On Saturday afternoon it said it had lost seven generation units at four power stations due to various technical faults. This has caused additional strain on its reserve capacity and in order to rebuild its emergency reserves for the coming week, there was an increased probability of load shedding on Saturday night. #POWERALERT 1Date: 07 March 2020Likelihood of loadshedding today has increased significantly following multiple generation unit trips@News24 @TimesLIVE @eNCA @iol @SABCNewsOnline @TheCitizen_News @SAfmRadio @POWER987News @ukhozi_fm @METROFMSA @ewnupdates @Newzroom405 pic.twitter.com/JE4JBtPp0e
