WASHINGTON - Bernie Sanders has won the Democratic primary in Colorado, US media projected, his second win of the night in the crucial Super Tuesday contests to pick a challenger to take on President Donald Trump. The western state sends 67 delegates to the party's convention and is Sanders' second win after his home state of Vermont. The self-described democratic socialist's main rival Joe Biden has so far won five of the 14 states up for grabs, mainly in the south where the former vice president has demonstrated the depth of his support among African Americans.
