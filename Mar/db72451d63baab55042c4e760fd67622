WATCH: Coronavirus numbers in SA will increase - Mkhize  He said COVID-19 was a notifiable disease, therefore, all names and contact details must be provided. “Regulation 20 states that any person who fails to comply with the regulations is guilty of an offence and can be imprisoned for up to 10 years.” Mkhize said private laboratories didn’t forward all information to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the institute had to search for missing patient information. “These unallocated names and patients mean we can’t reach the next one who is at risk – it’s not a nicety to fill the form it’s an obligation. We will now go back and check who is not complying with the law.” Mkhize said all exposed persons must be screened for the country to flatten the curve of the coronavirus.
