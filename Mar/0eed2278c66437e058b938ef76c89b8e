Aleck Skhosana and Winn agreed that all further comments and statements during the 30 days of postponements of all athletics activities in the country will only come through the national office of ASA. CAPE TOWN -  In a meeting held on Friday morning, Athletics South Africa (ASA) president Aleck Skhosana and the chairperson of the Comrades Marathon Association Cheryl Winn, clarified matters on the communication protocol over the long-distance race. Skhosana and Winn agreed that all further comments and statements during the 30-day suspension of all athletics activities in the country would only come through the national office of ASA. The meeting followed unhappiness expressed by the Minister of Sports Nathi Mthethwa earlier in the week, over a statement by the Comrades Marathon organisers that their 90km race would continue as scheduled. “We are both happy with the outcome of our discussion and we are on the same page. ASA will issue all statements during this period of the State of National Disaster caused by COVID-19, to avoid unintended misinterpretations. Both entities will then re-convene after 15 April to revisit this matter to map the way forward,” said Skhosana. Winn added: "I am happy with the meeting between President Skhosana and myself, and I wish to reiterate that the Comrades Marathon Association will take full guidance from ASA and the government."
