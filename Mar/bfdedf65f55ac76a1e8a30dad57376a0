Shark Attack is a three-year programme rolled out by WildOceans and the Shark Conservation Fund.  Project Manager Nicolene Chapman said sharks produce fewer off-spring than other fish and need concerted protection efforts. “We only ever hear about sharks when there is a film about them or a dramatic shark attack – we don’t ever hear about them in a way that sets them up as the victim, or shows how the ‘hunter’ is now the hunted.” WildOceans marketing and communications director Lauren van Nijkerk said: “We have 204 different sharks and ray species in the ocean which is more of a reason to protect them and of those 204, 69 are endemic.”
