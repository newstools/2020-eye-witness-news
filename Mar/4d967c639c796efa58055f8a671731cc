The young entrepreneur said although sleepless nights were inevitable when owning a restaurant, the last two weeks had been particularly stressful. Staffers at several outlets are undoubtedly worried about what the spread of coronavirus means for the future of their jobs. Martin who, owns a restaurant in the heart of the city, said although she had seen a drop in visitors, she was choosing to remain positive. “We have seen 17 of our restaurants close their doors. So, if the big boys close, what will little guys do?” Martin said she was still deciding whether to stop selling liquor altogether or whether to adjust shifts to the reduced hours.
