Australia and Canada have announced they will not send athletes to Tokyo if the Games were held this year. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) says they have not taken a decision on whether they support the postponement of the Olympics or a continuation of them this year. Australia and Canada have announced they will not be sending athletes to Tokyo if the Games were held this year. They have both called for them to be pushed to 2021. Speaking on where Sascoc stood, acting CEO Ravi Govender told Eyewitness News they are still weighing up options. “We have not yet taken a position on that because we believe we must be well informed," he said. "We also believe that we need to take advice from the World Health Organisation (WHO) as well as the IOC (International Olympic Committee).” With Chad le Clos having been forced to cancel his training camp in Turkey due to the country's travel ban, Govender has discussed what measures they want athletes to observe to stay safe during this period. “We are asking them to stay away from the crowds. We are asking them to go into some sort of self-isolation. We have asked them not to travel. International travel is definitely out. They are encouraged not to travel locally unless under extreme emergency and we are asking them to strictly observe health protocols that have been set out by our government”. Govender has also confirmed that SASCOC is in communication with Olympian Cameron van der Burgh after he confirmed that he had contracted COVID-19. "He’s based in the UK and unfortunately the UK has had challenges with the virus and he has contracted it there. I am informed that his national federation, his sports movement, has been in touch. We are informed that he is coping and is obviously in isolation."
