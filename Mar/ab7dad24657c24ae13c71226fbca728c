JOHANNESBURG - Stats SA has attributed the country's slow economic growth to declines in crucial sectors in the economy, including transport and agriculture. It said the country's economy slipped into a technical recession in the fourth quarter of last year, recording a 1.4% contraction. Annual GDP for 2019 managed to grow by only 0.2% The year-on-year GDP outcome was lower than the expected at 0.3% as recently forecast by National Treasury. The  South African Reserve Bank had also presented a revised prediction of 0.5% growth for 2019. But Stats SA's Michael Manamela painted a rather grim picture for the economy's overall performance. “Overall, the performance of the economy for the year was 0.2%, this coming from a growth of 0.8% in 2018.” Finance, real estate and business services were the biggest drivers of the economy, contributing half a percentage point to growth. These results are a setback for President Cyril Ramaphosa and his government, which has presented an economic growth plan.
