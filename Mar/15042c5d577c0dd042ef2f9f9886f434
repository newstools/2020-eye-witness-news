JOHANNESBURG – Disaster relief group The Gift of the Givers has extended a helping hand by setting up testing facilities. The organisation said the centres in some parts of Johannesburg were aimed at easing the pressure on government hospitals. The organisation said that it had roped in volunteers who were working with different private laboratories.
