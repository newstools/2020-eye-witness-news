The former DA youth leader is set to go against the interim leader John Steenhuisen and John Moodey when the party elects its new leader in May. DURBAN - Mbali Ntuli's hopes of becoming the Democratic Alliance (DA)’s next leader has received a boost from the party's provincial leader. Zwakele Mncwango has on Tuesday told Eyewitness News that he would be actively campaigning for Ntuli. The former DA youth leader is set to go against the interim leader John Steenhuisen and John Moodey when the party elects its new leader in May. Mncwango said contestation for the leadership of the DA was a difficult issue for the party in KwaZulu-Natal. This is because two of the three people who have so far raised their hands to become party leader come from the province. However, Mncwango said he’s made his decision: “I will be supporting Mbali Ntuli because I believe she represents the future of this organisation and the country. You need such people who can take the country forward, I believe that she has that energy and she has grown within the organisation. We know what she has done and what she has achieved.” Mncwango said he would be campaigning for Ntuli because he believed she was best suited for championing the party's dream of building one South Africa for all. He said Steenhuisen respected his decision.
