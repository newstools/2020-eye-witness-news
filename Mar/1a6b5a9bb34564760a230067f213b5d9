JOHANNESBURG - As government implemented measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), a nursing union called on government to adequately train and equip health professionals who were at the forefront of battling the virus. The Young Nurses Indaba Trade Union (YNITU) on Tuesday said it was concerned that the measures announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa  on Sunday didn’t go far enough to address issues faced by health workers. Ramaphosa announced travel bans from countries most affected by the virus, the shutdown of several ports of entry, and the closure of schools, amongst other measures.

Madumo-Gova said there was still a shortage of equipment and protective gear. The union said given these challenges, many workers considered their jobs as suicide missions.
