WASHINGTON, United States - The United States is suspending routine visa services in most countries because of the coronavirus pandemic, the State Department announced late Wednesday.

It did not specify which countries would be exempted from the suspension, which was in response to "worldwide challenges" related to the deadly pandemic.
