They say the DA administration had failed residents. DA interim leader John Steenhuisen is joined by other leaders from the national office, provincial, and local structures. The delegation is deliberating on the party's long-standing plans to usher in a way forward. Tshwane has been without a mayor since last week after the resignation of Stevens Mokgalapa.
