New Zealand players face being forced into self-isolation for two weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic. CAPE TOWN - The sporting fraternity have welcomed the postponement of the Super Rugby tournament due to the coronavirus outbreak. But some have different views and opinions on it. Tournament organisers decided on Saturday to suspend the competition indefinitely after the last weekendâ€™s games because New Zealand players returning home from matches overseas faced being forced into self-isolation for two weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic. SANZAAR, the body that runs Super Rugby, said the tournament would be off for the foreseeable future with only seven of 18 rounds of the regular season completed. The Stormers head coach John Dobson said after their 24-14 loss to the Sharks in Durban that he welcomed the decision to postpone the tournament, but felt it would affect poor people's jobs. "It's going to feel difficult for everybody. For the Sharks who won the game, I'm sure they don't want to suspend it, I think changing consequence of the reaction to this virus ... is going to see probably more hardship than a virus itself," said Dobson. "It will affect people's jobs, and their economy will be affected, and that is my greatest concern. It will horribly affect poor people, I understand the safety - if you ask our players or the Sharks, they want to play the game tomorrow, they'll say yes." "I mean, the reaction to it I just hope [we] pull through because it causes pain in people's lives. You close university - the students go home for six months, they come back the lectures, are piling into the university ... it carries on.  Everything is cancelled, the Epic is cancelled, and the car washes are closed, and poor people are losing jobs."
