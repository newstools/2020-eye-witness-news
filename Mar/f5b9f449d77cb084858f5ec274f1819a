The unit tripped earlier this week, which resulted in the latest bout of severe load shedding. Stage four was expected to continue until at least on Friday. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said: “The faulty pump at the Koeberg plant has now been repaired and it’s back in service. However, Eskom is now in the process of obtaining regulatory approval in order to return the whole unit back to service by Sunday.”  Eskom said more generating units were expected to come back online by Thursday evening. Mantshantsha said: “We hope these will ease the constraints on the rest of the generation fleet and it should, therefore, also help reduce the stage of load shedding.”
