The meeting ended with an agreement between Maile and De Ruyter with the MEC committing to pay Eskom monthly until the debt is settled. “We’ll meet in the next month and Eskom will suspend the attachment upon receipt of R50 million and then within the next two weeks the CEO and myself will receive a plan that in our view must be realistic,” Maile said.
