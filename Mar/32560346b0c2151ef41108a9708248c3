Hospitals are already overcrowded, some infrastructure is old and there aren’t enough doctors. Mkhize said that government was in talks with private hospitals, hoping they would open their doors for COVID-19 patients who may not be covered by medical aid or don’t have money for exclusive health care. "The agree is there. It's a principal agreement to say we're counting all the birds." Mkhize said that private and public health facilities were already sharing resources. "We're looking at who's got what stock and where we can move the staff from private to public." The minister said that at the end of the day, whatever services were there to fight the virus must be made available for all.
