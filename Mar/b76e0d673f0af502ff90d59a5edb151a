Over the past three weeks, at least four children have been killed in Cape Town. The group of protestors held placards which read: “hands off our children” and “stop killing us”. SA Women Fightback founder Bronwyn Litkie said they wanted to see action from government. “Nothing has been done, if anything, we have seen more bloodshed. We want answers and action from government,” she said. #GenderBasedViolence Ambassador for SA Women Fightback, Venetia Orgill from Mitchells Plain had chains and crime scene tapes around her body.
