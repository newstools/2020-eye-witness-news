The 13-year-old pupil died in January on a school camp after a makeshift raft he and other learners had built collapsed in the Crocodile River at the Nyathi Bush Resort in Brits. A forensic probe has found that some of the teachers and the resort be held responsible for Mpianzi's death. The NPA’s Phindi Mjonondwane said: “We can confirm as the NPA that the docket into the death of Enock Mpianzi is with the office of the director of public prosecutions in North Gauteng and it was brought to the NPA for a decision.
