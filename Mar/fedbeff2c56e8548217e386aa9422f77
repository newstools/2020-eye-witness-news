The men are accused of murdering Sibusiso Amos at his home in Vosloorus during lockdown patrols in the area on Sunday. VOSLOORUS - The court case involving an Ekurhuleni metro police officer and a private security official has been postponed to 8 April following a brief appearance on Tuesday afternoon. The men are accused of murdering Sibusiso Amos at his home in Vosloorus during lockdown patrols in the area on Sunday. They also face four attempted murder charges after three children and an adult were injured during the shooting. Five extra charges were added to the docket. The Boksburg Magistrates Court postponed the matter to allow the State time to prepare its case at which point the accused would also get a chance to apply for bail. Although two men were arrested for the shooting, only the private security official Siphiwe Ndlovu appeared in court. Additional to the murder and multiple attempted murder charges, Ndlovu is facing seven other accusations including unlawful possession of a shotgun and the unlawful possession of ammunition.
