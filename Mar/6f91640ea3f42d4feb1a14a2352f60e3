The league held a board of governors meeting on Thursday to map a way forward for the remainder of the season. SAFA reiterated the fact that all football in the country will be suspended until 4 April. The rising coronavirus pandemic had seen games this week called off and now Khoza said that the situation would continue indefinitely. "Hopefully we will conclude the league before the 30th of June but the situation is uncertain and were are flexible because anything can happen at any time. We might call it off if the situation arises and we have to reconsider the position of the PSL," he said. Khoza said that they are “dealing with human lives” and that they had to take the appropriate action to ensure everyone’s safety. Khoza, also admitted they did not know just how much of a financial cost a continued suspension of the league would be worth. "If we are not acting responsibly the economy can collapse, so where are you going to do business if there is no human capital, so the important thing now is to concentrate on that and make sure we do our bit," he said.
