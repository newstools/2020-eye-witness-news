CAPE TOWN - Mamelodi Sundowns have closed the gap with the Absa Premiership log leaders Kaizer Chiefs with just only four points. Sundowns struggled passed Stellenbosch to get 1-0 at Athlone Stadium on Wednesday thanks to Themba Zwane's eighth-minute strike. The Pretoria based side have one game in hand having played 21 matches with 44 points while Chiefs sitting with 48 points. Coach Pitso Mosimane said the league was being decided in May; he believes Sundowns still has a chance to retain the title. "The league is decided in May, guys, we should humble ourselves and keep calm - keep our feet on the ground," said Mosimane. "We are holding onto the trophy, we don't want it out of the cabinet, we're still seeing it and we're still loving it. We can't release it, we are trying to protect it. What can you do? A game in hand means nothing, we had two games in hand at least, we got rid of one until you get rid of the game in hand and you've won it, then you can start looking at the table differently." The premiership takes a break this weekend so that the Nedbank Cup Cup quarter-finals can be staged with the visit of Sundowns to Highlands Park the standout fixture.
