MTN will expand its access to zero-rated websites by providing free online educational resources to help learners stay on track with their schoolwork. JOHANNESBURG - MTN said it would increase its infrastructure to accommodate the high volumes of network traffic as more South Africans worked from home to curb the transmission of COVID-19. The cellular network has announced that its monthly prepaid data bundles of one gigabyte and below will cost 25% to 50% less from 15 April. MTN is the second telecommunication giant to slash its prices â€“ Vodacom has reduced its prices by at least 30% following recommendations by the Competition Commission in December. MTN said its decision to bring down the cost of communication would help South Africans as communities, businesses, and families were encouraged to work from home. CEO Geoffery Motsa said its 1GB monthly data bundle would go down by 33%. Motsa said that the mobile operator would also provide 20MB of free data daily to each of its customers through its instant messaging platform. "We'll provide free internet browsing from midnight to 5am every day by just waking up with a yellow SIM card. You'll have 20MB of data." MTN will expand its access to zero-rated websites by providing free online educational resources to help learners stay on track with their schoolwork. "We are saying that from public health, public colleges, public universities, to high schoolers, we will provide zer-rated content, so they don't remain disconnected." In addition, MTN will be strengthening its network.
