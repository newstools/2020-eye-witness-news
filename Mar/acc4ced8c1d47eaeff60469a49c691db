Jamie Roberts, who is a medical doctor, has allowed a front-line medic to live in his Cardiff flat to help the fight against COVID-19. CAPE TOWN - The Stormers centre Jamie Roberts has on Tuesday shared insights and advice to South Africans on how to deal with global coronavirus pandemic. Roberts, who is a medical doctor, has allowed a front-line medic to live in his Cardiff flat to help the fight against COVID-19. The 33-year-old has remained in South Africa with the Stormers while the global crisis unfolds. "South Africa have a wonderful opportunity over the next week or two to really take this seriously - and it's difficult for people to take it seriously until the numbers really increase," he said. "On that kind of perspective, it's tough but we've seen what's happening in the UK, USA and Europe and I think it's clear to see everyone is on the internet. Those who have internet or can watch the news can see what's going on in those countries. It's nothing different to the message that is out there, you limit contact and keeping a distance from people, you wash your hands and you don't put yourself into the social situation if you don't have to."
