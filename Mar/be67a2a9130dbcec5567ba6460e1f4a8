Pitso Mosimane spoke to the media after Sundowns' 1-0 victory over Stellenbosch FC at Athlone Stadium on Wednesday. CAPE TOWN - Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane said the news that Kaizer Chiefs midfielder George Maluleka was joining Sundowns were just rumours. Mosimane spoke to the media after Sundowns' 1-0 victory over Stellenbosch FC at Athlone Stadium on Wednesday night. The Pretoria-based side have one game in hand having played 21 matches with 44 points while Chiefs sitting with 48 points. Mosimane refused to speak on the news that the Chiefs midfielder is joining Sundowns next season. "I don't want to speak on George Maluleka -  Sundowns must speak on him, I'm not Sundowns - I'm the coach. Let Sundowns announce him, until they announce him, then it will be official," said Mosimane. "At the moment its a rumour. Do I want to be a spokesperson for Kaizer Chiefs guys?" Mosimane admitted the club will have new players next season and asked about Maritzburg United Ghanaian goalkeeper Richard Ofori and Ajax Cape Town starlet Grant Margeman, he said: "Richard Ofori is not a Sundowns player, Grant is a good player, we love him. Sundowns will kill me if I reveal things, I must wait for the team to reveal and hand the jerseys and I don't want to spoil that event but we like Grant."
