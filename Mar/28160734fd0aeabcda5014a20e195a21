CAPE TOWN -Winger Sbu Nkosi is one of a handful of changes to the Sharks team that has been named for the Super Rugby clash with the Jaguares at Kings Park Stadium on Saturday. Last week, head coach Sean Everitt rested flankers James Venter and Tyler Paul and both have been restored to the starting line-up, as has wing Sbu Nkosi. Nkosi is back to full fitness and Madosh Tambwe has been shifted to the bench. The outcome will have a strong bearing on how the South African Conference will look on Saturday with the Sharks gaining the opportunity to go top should they defeat the Jaguares. Sharks: 15.
