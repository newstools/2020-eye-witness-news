SAA operations at the King Shaka International Airport came to a halt at the weekend. Premier Zikalala termed the decision by SAA's business rescue practitioners to cancel flights to Surban as economic sabotage. He said that heâ€™d taken this matter to Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and talks had been favourable. "We can happily say and report to this House that we've had very positive engagements with the minister and all other stakeholders. We are doing quite well and we are impressed with the fact that soon SAA will come back into operation." Zikalala said that his administration would not allow SAA to cut jobs in Durban.
