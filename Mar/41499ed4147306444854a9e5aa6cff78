Funzela Ngobeni resigned from the DA to join Herman Mashaba's People's Dialogue. JOHANNESBURG - Former Democratic Alliance Johannesburg chairperson and caucus leader Funzela Ngobeni said that he decided to ditch the party because he'd bought into Herman Mashaba's vision for South Africa. Ngobeni resigned from the DA to join Mashaba's People's Dialogue. Mashaba has announced that former DA CEO Paul Boughey had also joined his movement. Last month, Graham Chatters resigned as chief of staff to the party's leader just days after the party's communications manager Mabine Seabe left. Ngobeni said that it was time to give Mashaba's new party a chance. "Some of the things that he's been proposing are things that most of us have been thinking about and a lot of South Africans have been looking at and I think the time is now... the ANC is back in Johannesburg, back in Tshwane, in Nelson Mandela Bay... it's not good for the residents of Johannesburg." Herman Mashaba has described both Ngobeni and Paul Boughey as skilled, experienced and great South Africans who would contribute immensely to his new political movement. Ngobeni - just like Mashaba and Mmusi Maimane - said that he had decided to leave the DA because he was unhappy about the trajectory the party was taking. Ngobeniâ€™s resignation now brought to three the number of senior DA members who had resigned in just two months. Mashaba said that there were more people joining his political movement coming from across the political spectrum. He said that he would make them known in due course.
