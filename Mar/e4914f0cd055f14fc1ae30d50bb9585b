The Cape side currently has five Springbok players sidelined with long-term injuries as Super Rugby heads into an indefinite break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CAPE TOWN - The Stormers will be meeting with SA Rugby Director of Rugby Rassie Erasmus later this week to discuss the injury exodus the side is facing. The Cape side currently has five Springbok players sidelined with long-term injuries as Super Rugby heads into an indefinite break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The players includes captain Siya Kolisi (he was a 10-12 week injury - a Grade 3 medial collateral ligament tear), Bongi Mbonambi (hamstring injury), Herschel Jantjies (fractured his fibula), Steven Kitshoff (tore a pectoral muscle) and Pieter-Steph du Toit (haematoma that developed into an acute compartment syndrome). Both head coach John Dobson and team doctor Jason Suter agreed that there's nothing that could've been done to prevent the injuries. "We have to keep calm about everything - I'm really chuffed about the resilience of the group," said Dobson. "As I said, we sill sit with SA Rugby... I'll sit with Rassie later this week and discuss these injures." Suter added: "All the injuries we have, there is no common pattern - there's isn't a common body part - so to answer your question around the Springboks: is there any overload and the short answer is no. We played seven games and had a bye. "Siya has played 40 minutes, so have we overplayed him? No. So I think I'm comfortable to sit with Rassie to say there's nothing we could've prevented."
