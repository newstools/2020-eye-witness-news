The Mail & Guardian reported on Friday that SANDF members didn’t want to risk their own lives by travelling to the epicentre of the coronavirus. But, SANDF spokesperson Siphiwe Dlamini said this couldn’t be further from the truth. Dlamini said soldiers were trained for these kinds of missions where there was a high risk. “We are trained for any eventuality including losing our lives, and that’s our business and responsibility. We have given the state our lives so that they can use us in any way that they would like to,” he said. Government secured the aircraft to bring the citizens home but said it was still negotiating with other service providers for a quarantine area.
