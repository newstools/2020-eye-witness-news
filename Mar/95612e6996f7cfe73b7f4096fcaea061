The group of refugees has been living outside the local police station after they were removed from the Central Methodist Church in the CBD last month. CAPE TOWN – Authorities in Cape Town said they'll be enforcing by-laws by acting against refugees who have been living around the local police station. The group has been living outside the station after they were removed from the Central Methodist Church in the CBD last month. The City's JP Smith said the group at the police station has been instructed to vacate the sidewalks. “The City is enforcing its by-laws that say you are not allowed to stay overnight in a public place or erect structures, etc. This morning we went to issue compliance notices. We issued everybody with a fine or section 56 notice. Everyone cooperated fully and the sidewalks were cleaned.” At the same time, Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has pleaded with residents to stay at home in efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus. At least 74 people are being treated for COVID-19 in the province so far. Winde has stressed the importance of following all the necessary preventative measures. “We need to be staying at home, please stay at home. If you are an essential worker, please make sure that you keep your 1.5m distance.”
