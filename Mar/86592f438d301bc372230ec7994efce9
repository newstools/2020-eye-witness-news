Tokelo Rantie's career is currently in limbo after he was released from his contract with Mamelodi Sundowns at the end of last year after going AWOL. CAPE TOWN - Bloemfontein Celtic has on Tuesday vow to give the former Bafana Bafana striker Tokelo Rantie a second chance after the Free State-born trains with the club. The 29-year-old forward's career is currently in limbo after he was released from his contract with Mamelodi Sundowns at the end of last year after going AWOL. Celtic coach Lehlohonolo Seema said the club had put Rantie on high-performance centre to speed up his fitness process. He believes Rantie deserves a second chance. "Rantie is still training with us - we haven't started assessing him that much, we still conditioning him very well because he was far with his fitness," said Seema. "The only thing we are doing we are giving him is a second chance - he might train up until the end of the season if he doesn't come right. He can start pre-season with us. The way it is going for now, if you ask me now or the next two weeks, I'll say no but you know how these things change. We are trying to give him special training sessions - high-performance centre - the sooner we push him, the better because the quality is there."
