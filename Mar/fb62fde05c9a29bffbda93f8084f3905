JOHANNESBURG - Premier Soccer League chairperson Dr Irvin Khoza has confirmed the suspension of all midweek and weekend matches in all competitions with immediate effect. Speaking at a media briefing on Monday, Dr Khoza said: "This is a very challenging moment in the countryâ€™s history. It is important for us as the PSL to adjudicate the matters raised by the President [Cyril Ramaphosa], and the role we can play to help get messages across to the public. "So that means matches in the midweek and this weekend are suspended. There will be a meeting of the executive on Thursday to discuss these matters once we have more information. At the same time, the league took the decision that the MultiChoice Diski Challenge is discontinued immediately." Khoza said that the PSL would hold a meeting with all 32 of its members on Thursday to discuss all the options and the way forward. "If we suspend the season, the question that comes up is what about promotion and relegation? The Board of Governors with the clubs, will make sure we make the best decision for the country. We will be supportive of what the government wants us to do." Khoza added that while games are suspended, teams could continue training.
