JOHANNESBURG – The University of Johannesburg (UJ) has joined many South African organisations in paying tribute to internationally renowned hotel tycoon Sol Kerzner. Kerzner, who founded Sun International and the Southern Sun Group died of cancer at his Hout Bay home in Cape Town on Saturday at the age of 84. The institution said Kerzner made an immense contribution towards building UJ's multimillion rand School of Tourism and Hospitality at the Auckland Park campus. Dean of faculty of economics and business management Daneel van Lill says the businessman believed in UJ. “He literally laid the foundation of the school of hospitality and tourism in the year that UJ was founded. The school is now ranked 18th. Among the many memories, we best recall his family values, his sense of humour and the admiration of our students, industry partners and staff alike.”
