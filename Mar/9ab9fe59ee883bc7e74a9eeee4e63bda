Mpianzi drowned in the Crocodile River in the North West in January. JOHANNESBURG - The media have been asked to leave the meeting at the Parktown Boys’ High School where the findings of a report into the death of grade 8 pupil Enock Mpianzi was being released. He drowned in the Crocodile River during a school visit to the Nyati Bush and Riverbreak Lodge on 15 January. His parents were given the report on Wednesday morning and parents at the school were being addressed by MEC Panyaza Lesufi on Wednesday evening. Lesufi recognised that parents were angry and asked the media to leave. “So, that is why I want to apologise and hopefully, they will also in the process learn why parents feel the way they feel about their presence. That’s how I want to cover this particular matter.”
