Autopax operates long-distance buses City to City and Translux and is a subsidiary of Prasa. JOHANNESBURG - The troubled Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) said it had extended its loan to Autopax so that the bus operator was able to pay workers' salaries. Autopax operates long-distance buses City to City and Translux and is a subsidiary of Prasa. Last month, the bus company paid workers only a quarter of their salaries due to cash flow problems. Prasa spokesperson Makhosini Mgitywa said the money would be in by Thursday. "We apologise profusely as the leadership of Prasa for the inconvenience caused to employees of Autopax. We will endeavour that in future that all salaries are paid in full in the contractually agreed time." The railway agency has been placed under administration due to allegations of corruption and maladministration.
