Education was second with R25 billion, while social services would receive R2.6 billion. "So that you live in a healthy and safe environment and your children's schools are a safe place for learning so that you can travel safely to work and so that you can enjoy our beautiful environment." Finance MEC David Maynier said that the province's safety plan would get R481 million to get more law enforcement boots on the ground. Altogether, the Community Safety Department would receive R804 million for various projects and interventions.
