People suspected of having contracted the virus, cannot refuse medical examination, treatment, isolation or quarantine. JOHANNESBURG/CAPE TOWN -The Cooperative Governance Department (Cogta) on Thursday said South Africans would face jail time if they chose to ignore the new regulations aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19. Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma gazetted new regulations in line with the Disaster Management Act to legally bolster social distancing during the pandemic. Anyone who intentionally exposes others to the disease can be arrested and prosecuted for assault, attempted murder or murder. Fake news peddlers should also beware. You can be fined and jailed for six months if you spread disinformation. President Ramaphosa has warned fake news isn't helping matters. “We should be alert to disinformation, rumours, fake news and make sure that we do not disseminate fake news, rumour mongering or unverified information. Restaurants, bars, clubs and shebeens must also close at 6 pm and can only host 50 people at a time. The new regulations mean that bars, shebeens and some restaurants will have to close up shop by 6 pm and can only reopen at 9 am. The law said anyone who allows gatherings of more than 50 people in establishments where liquor is sold would be guilty of a criminal offence. The same goes for anyone who hinders law enforcement officials from performing their duties. Cooperative governance spokesperson Lungi Mtshali said: “Alcohol may not be served after 18:00 on weekdays and on weekends and public holidays, until 13:00.” He said Dlamini-Zuma had the buy-in of other government departments including police to enforce these new regulations. Meanwhile, in Gauteng Premier David Makhura says all residents will now have to notify the police about funeral and wedding arrangements to ensure that they comply with these regulations.
