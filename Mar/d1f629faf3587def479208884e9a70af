Currently, games are suspended due to the coronavirus, but the board of governors has tentatively agreed to finish the season on 30 June. JOHANNESBURG - SuperSport United CEO Stan Matthews admits that should the current season be declared null and void it would have legal implications for the league. Currently, games are suspended due to the coronavirus, but the board of governors has tentatively agreed to finish the season on 30 June. With no clear indication of when the virus will stop spreading, Matthews has discussed what it would mean if the season does not conclude. “No one wants to land up in the court of arbitration for sport,” he told Eyewitness News. “No one wants to land up in the high court. We want to see that this is done in a proper way but we also don’t need to panic just yet. There is only, by and large, six to eight fixtures that we need to fulfill”. Matthews has also revealed that SuperSport's players are on lockdown at the moment, and all staff are working from home, while their youth academies are closed. “We’ve been on a break since Friday (20 March) and our players will not be back until at least 17 April. Our players are all in lockdown at their normal places of residence. We have one player stuck in Botswana and he will conduct his activities from there. We’ve set up online portals for the players.” Matthews added that right now was not the time to be concerned about the postponement of sport but to show kindness to others. “This is what is required of us… to shine a better light on humanity. How we are there for other people and not just smash and grab ‘I’m alright’ and pull up the ladder. We all have to be mindful. We may be transmitters. We may inadvertently be harming other people. It’s a good time to take stock of ourselves.”
