CAPE TOWN - Angry community members are trying to force their way into the court where the man accused of murdering eight-year-old Tazne van Wyk is due to make his first court appearance. People outside the courtroom door were chanting "We want justice" and "Let us in" as several police officers tried keep the doors closed as protesters were fighting to make their way inside the already packed courtroom. Van Wyk's alleged killer, 54-year-old Moehydien Pangaker, is expected to appear in court soon. Pangaker was arrested in Cradock in the Eastern Cape on Monday and upon his return to the Western Cape two days later, he led police to a stormwater pipe on the N1 near Worcester where the child’s body was dumped. #TazneVanWyk More and more people are fighting to make their way inside.
