Ngcobo – an SANDF soldier at the time – was stationed in the Northern Cape in January 2017 when he started suspecting his girlfriend of cheating on him. He drove back to Durban with the intention of murdering her and then taking his own life. But when he arrived, the girlfriend was not at her home and he found the girlfriend’s sister, whom he killed. He also wounded another person who was at the house at the time. He then kidnapped the girlfriend’s brother and tried to coerce him to search for her.
