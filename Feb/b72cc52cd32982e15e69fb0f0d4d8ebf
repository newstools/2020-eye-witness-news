The Stellenbosch-based side is aiming for the top eight finish following their 1-0 victory over SuperSport United at Cape Town Stadium last Friday. CAPE TOWN - Stellenbosch FC coach Steve Barker said that getting 33 points in the Absa Premiership was still the main focus for the club. The Stellenbosch-based side was aiming for a top eight finish following their 1-0 victory over SuperSport United at Cape Town Stadium last Friday. Barker admitted that the league was different, saying that no game was easier as they were trying to take it one match at the time. Stellies are currently sitting ninth on the log with 27 points after playing 22 matches. "Right at the beginning of the season, I was asked what our target was for the season. I said our first target was to get 33 points. I said the quicker we get there, [the better]. We have games in hand and we can reassess and aim higher than that," said Barker. "That still remains our main focus to get 33 points and I believe will be sufficient and if we still have three, four, five games left, whatever the case may be. I think we can play with a little bit more freedom." "You don't want to take away the momentum that you have but I think at the same time, this league is strong enough that no games are easier. We, as the team, we have to play our best to win football matches... we are not Mamelodi Sundowns where they can get an off day but still get the results." Barker said that keeping the focus and potential would help the club to grow. "We have to play to our full potential every week, hence we have to stay on top of what we're doing and just keep the focus, the commitment and just keep the confidence of the team," said Barker. "My biggest challenge right now is to maintain the commitment but getting the place to continue playing with more confidence for the full duration of the match... we seemed to be doing it in patches at the beginning of the season."
