Hundreds of EFF members from different regions were already at Innesfree Park while others continued to stream in with different modes of transport, including buses. They were gearing themselves up for what they termed the “people’s march” to Megawatt Park. Protesters were also joined by coal truck drivers from different companies. #EFFEskomMarch ATM leader Vuyo Zungula says his party is there to support the EFF to show that parties can put aside political differences to do what is in the interest of the public.

Meanwhile, some parts of Katherine Street were closed to traffic while other streets that were expected to be affected included Grayston Drive, Rivonia Street, and Witkoppen Road.
