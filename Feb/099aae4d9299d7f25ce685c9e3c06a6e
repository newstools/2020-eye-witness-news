The eight-year-old’s aunt, Samantha Viljoen, never expected that her niece would become another victim of violent crime. "Stop killing our children. They are our future. They're children... they're supposed to be something in life... why are you doing this?" Louise Wingrove, a neighbour who helped search for Van Wyk, was in disbelief. "I was so heart sore when my daughter finished her night shift and told me that the little girl was murdered." Moehydien Pangaker will appear in the Goodwood magistrates court on Friday.
