The SA Rugby Player of the Year said that since winning the World Cup he can feel that the Springbok players were being scrutinised more and believed that in some games he was being targeted more but that it came with the territory. CAPE TOWN - The Stormers strengthened their hold at the top of the overall Super Rugby table over the weekend and will now look to pile on the points before travelling for the Australiasian leg of their campaign. The Cape side have been lucky to have the services of the World Rugby player of the year Pieter-Steph du Toit for all four of their matches. This means that Du Toit has played 320 minutes of Super Rugby so far and he said he was just doing what is asked of him. The Stormers will host the Blues this weekend at Newlands and Du Toit knows the importance of going into a bye weekend with a win. "If you love what you do it's always nice to have and get the energy at certain places, nice dreams and opportunities and I always try to achieve that," said du Toit. "At some stage, your body gets tired but I hope to get a rest later on the season, but at the moment I'm just doing my job. The SA Rugby Player of the Year said that since winning the World Cup he can feel that the Springbok players were being scrutinised more and believed that in some games he was being targeted more but that it came with the territory. "There's a lot going around at the moment, people paying attention to individuals, so you have to be smart doing the things you want to do. So, winning the World Cup has an impact on your personal life as well," he said. "Of course at some stage of the games I feel there's this unfairness towards me, it kind of wants to make me upset but I try to play better rugby."
