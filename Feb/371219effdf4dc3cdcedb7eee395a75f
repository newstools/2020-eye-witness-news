ISTANBUL â€“ Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said Sunday eight people were killed in eastern Turkey after a 5.7 magnitude earthquake hit neighbouring Iran, the official Anadolu news agency reported. He said three of the dead were children, adding that some other people were believed to be trapped under the rubble. Turkish broadcaster NTV showed images of damage in several villages in Van province on the Iran border. "Search and rescue efforts are ongoing," Soylu said.

The epicentre of the quake, which struck at 9:23 am (0553 GMT), was near the Iranian village of Habash-e Olya, less than 10 kilometres from the border, according to the US Geological Survey.
