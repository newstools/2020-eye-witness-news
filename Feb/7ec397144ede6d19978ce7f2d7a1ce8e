The 67-year-old was found not guilty, however, of first-degree rape and predatory sexual assault charges that could have seen him jailed for life. NEW YORK, United States - Disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was on Monday convicted of sexual assault and rape but cleared of the most serious predatory sexual assault charges. The jury of seven men and five women found the producer guilty of criminal sexual acts in the first degree and rape in the third degree, a partial victory for the #MeToo movement that considered the case a watershed moment. The 67-year-old was found not guilty, however, of first-degree rape and predatory sexual assault charges that could have seen him jailed for life. The verdict marks the most high-profile sex assault conviction in the United States since Bill Cosby was found guilty in 2018 of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman 15 years ago. The decision was announced in a packed New York courtroom where some 100 people had gathered. The defendant, who attended the trial hunched over a walker, was shielded from view by police officers. More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct since allegations against him ignited the #MeToo global reckoning against men abusing positions of power in October 2017. But the jury was considering charges related to just two: ex-actress Jessica Mann and former production assistant Mimi Haleyi, with many claims too old to prosecute. One of the predatory sexual assault charges also included testimony from the Sopranos actress Annabella Sciorra, who said Weinstein raped her in her New York apartment in the winter of 1993-94. Six women took the stand from the opening of testimony on 22 January, to say they had been sexually assaulted by Weinstein. Weinstein's team subjected the women to ferocious cross-examination as they argued that his relationships were consensual and transactional. The prosecution presented no forensic evidence or third-party witness accounts. The state's case rested on asking the jury to believe the women. NEXT STOP, LA Weinstein, who has always said his sexual relations were consensual, was charged with raping former actress Mann in the DoubleTree hotel in midtown Manhattan in 2013. He was also charged with forcing oral sex on former production assistant Haleyi at his New York apartment in July 2006 while she was on her period. Mann and Young both testified that Weinstein's genitals appeared deformed, during graphic and at times uncomfortable testimony, as the prosecution showed jurors nude photos of Weinstein to corroborate their accounts. The charges of predatory sexual assault, a serious sex crime committed against more than one person, were the most serious and carried a sentence of life in prison. For the jury to convict Weinstein of that they would have had to believe either Mann or Haleyi plus Sciorra. Sciorra's allegation was too old to be prosecuted as an individual crime but she was included in the indictment to bolster the predatory sexual assault charge. Ex-model Lauren Young also told the court that Weinstein sexually assaulted her in the bathroom of a Beverly Hills hotel room in 2013 when she was a 22-year-old aspiring actress. Judge Burke dismissed the jury just after noon Monday, thanking them for their "care" and "attention." Eyes now turn to Los Angeles, where Young's allegations form part of a separate sex crimes investigation against Weinstein being carried out by prosecutors in the California city. Los Angeles prosecutors accuse him of raping an Italian model in February 2013 and of assaulting Young the following night.
