Mokgalapa is expected to appear before the party's federal legal commission for bringing the party into disrepute. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Sunday said a disciplinary process against former Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa was still ongoing. Mokgalapa is expected to appear before the party's federal legal commission for bringing the party into disrepute. He resigned and is expected to vacate office at the end of this month. He's in hot water after a leaked audio clip revealed he made disparaging remarks about some members of his administration. He's also accused of engaging in sexual relations in the office with former mayoral committee member Sheila Senkubuge. DA interim leader John Steenhuisen said Mokgalapa’s fate had not yet been decided by the party. Embattled Mokgalapa resigned from this position earlier this month after the da gave him an ultimatum to quit or be fired. Once he vacates his position, he will face the federal legal commission over the allegations and bringing the party into disrepute. Steenhuisen said the process was still under way: “The federal legal commission and once that is finalised, we will take it through to the federal executive for us to consider and we will obviously weigh up the findings of that report and we can make recommendations in that regard.” The party has nominated Randall Williams to replace Mokgalapa as Mayor of Tshwane.
