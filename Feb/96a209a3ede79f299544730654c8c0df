Coach Hawies Fourie believes that Coetzee is a key member of his side at the moment and the calmness he gives the side in the setpiece has seen it become one of their attacking weapons. CAPE TOWN - Prop Aranos Coetzee will be the first South African player to earn his 50th PRO14 cap when the Cheetahs take on Leinster at the RDS Arena in Dublin on Saturday. Coach Hawies Fourie believes that Coetzee is a key member of his side at the moment and the calmness he gives the side in the setpiece has seen it become one of their attacking weapons. Fourie only made one change to the Cheetahs team with Gerhard Olivier returning from injury, replacing Daniel Maartens on the bench. He believes that the key factor for his team is their attitude and whether they give themselves a chance against a Leinster side missing some Irish internationals. “We are going there with the knowledge they are the strongest team in the competition, but we know if we pitch up on the day, then we will have a chance to win. And if you don’t think you have a chance to win, then you might as well not be in this competition," he said. Cheetahs: 15. Rhyno Smith, 14. Clayton Blommetjies, 13. William Small-Smith, 12.
