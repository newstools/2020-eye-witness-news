Ramaphosa defended his consensus-building approach, saying that forging compacts were no sign of weakness but rather, the building blocks to deal with the country’s social and economic woes. “We find ourselves today at a decisive moment.

He promised action to put the economy on track to recovery. “This year, we fix the fundamentals. We pursue critical areas of growth,” he said.
