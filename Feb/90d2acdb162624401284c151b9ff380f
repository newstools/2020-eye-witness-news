Rooi Mahamutsa joins the Urban Warriors for the remainder of the season as the club sets its sights on a first league title. CAPE TOWN - GladAfrica Championship log leaders Ajax Cape Town have on Tuesday announced the signing of former Orlando Pirates defender Rooi Mahamutsa for the remainder of the season. Mahamutsa joins the Urban Warriors for the remainder of the season as the club sets its sights on a first league title. Mahamutsa helped Free State Stars to the 2018 Nedbank Cup trophy, playing every minute of their run to the title. “The world works in a strange way - I’ve always admired Ajax as a club and as a brand for many years,” said Mahamutsa. “At my age, you wouldn’t think that I would have the honour of working with the best academy in Africa but here I am. To the Ajax faithful, I am looking forward to wearing your treasured red and white kit and I will fight for this title as if I came through your academy.”
