Joburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo held a briefing on issues including service delivery, emergency management services and operational concerns. JOHANNESBURG - Joburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo on Wednesday said the city was on the brink of financial collapse The mayor held a briefing on issues including service delivery, emergency management services and operational concerns. He said populist policies and decision making by the former Mayor Herman Mashaba rendered the city dysfunctional. Makhubo said the Democratic Alliance (DA)-led administration brought the city to the financial collapse and created an environment of maladministration. “We are in trouble financially as a city as a direct result of irresponsible management of the city in the last three years, including diversion of resources to meet these ends.” However, Mashaba has strongly denied this. The mayor said there had been blatant and illegal political interference within various operations in the city. Makhubo said various departments and entities of the city had been mismanaged. He also said since Mashaba's appointment, the emergency management services department had only five operational fire engines to service five million residents, despite R172 million having been paid upfront to a service provider. “To date, not a single fire truck has been delivered in the city. Only 19 auxiliaries, 17 vehicles were delivered and these do not meet the specifications of the EMS department.” But Mashaba has hit back at these claims, saying they were simply untrue. The mayor has, however, assured residents that besides these challenges the city is prioritising service delivery.
