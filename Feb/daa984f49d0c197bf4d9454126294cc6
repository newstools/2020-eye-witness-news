JOHANNESBURG - It's not every day you see a wild animal cruising the streets of any town or city in South Africa. That is why customers were treated to a rare sight when a big hippo dropped by a petrol garage in KwaZulu-Natal over the weekend. The animal was spotted strolling into the Engen/OK Express garage in St Lucia on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast on Sunday night and was recorded by a passerby. The video was posted on the OK Express Facebook page. "St Lucia town is surrounded by a large lake and extensive natural habitat for wildlife," the store explained.
