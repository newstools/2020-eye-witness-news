Ramaphosa added, while there was much to celebrate in the country, South Africa had a long way to go to realise Madiba's dream of a united nation. “We can be proud of our achievements in entrenching the democracy that Nelson Mandela led us so ably to install, but yet there is much we can be less proud of,” he said.
