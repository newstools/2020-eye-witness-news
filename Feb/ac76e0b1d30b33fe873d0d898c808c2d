Around 2,000 new cases were reported on Wednesday, with 1,638 in the hard-hit province of Hubei, where the outbreak emerged in December. The new virus is believed to have emerged last year in a market that sells wild animals in Hubei's capital Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. The virus was officially named "COVID-19" at a conference in Geneva held by the World Health Organisation (WHO), where the body's chief said countries had a chance of stopping its global spread. WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Tuesday that although 99% of cases are in China, where it remains "very much an emergency," it also "holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world." He urged countries to share data in order to further research the disease.
