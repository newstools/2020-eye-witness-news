Temba Bavuma suffered a hamstring strain during the decider of the three-match series against England while Heinrich Klaasen suffered a right hip injury during the team's warm-up session. CAPE TOWN - Proteas assistant coach Enoch Nkwe has confirmed batsmen Temba Bavuma and Heinrich Klaasen will undergo a fitness test later on Tuesday ahead of their third T20 against Australia at Newlands on Wednesday. Bavuma suffered a hamstring strain, which he picked up during the decider of the three-match series against England in Centurion while Klaasen suffered a right hip injury during the team's warm-up session ahead of the T20I series opener against Australia in Johannesburg. Nkwe said the team did miss Bavuma at the top of the order. He said they would have to adapt if Bavuma would not be available. "We do miss him but we have a big squad and good enough players that are flexible to bat in different positions," said Nkwe. "We've looked at it as an opportunity also to see which other players are adapting to different positions. Temba has been playing well so hopefully he'll be back in the mix as soon as possible - as soon as he is fit - but if he's not available, we'll look at what's best for these conditions in Cape Town." Nkwe has also spoken about certainty in the team, saying no one's place in the team was guaranteed ahead of the T20 World Cup later this year. "I don't think anyone is certain for any positions to be honest - we still have a long way to the world cup. There's plenty of games in the squad, it is big squad, we still have Sri Lanka coming, we still got West Indies and Pakistan down the line."
