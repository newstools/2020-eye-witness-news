South Africa will kick off their T20 World Cup campaign on Sunday, 23 February with a Pool B clash against England at the WACA in Perth. JOHANNESBURG - The Proteas Women suffered a four-wicket defeat to host nation, Australia, on Tuesday in their final warm-up match of the ICC T20 Women’s Cricket World Cup. After losing the toss and being asked to bat first, the Proteas Women got off to an ideal start as opening pair Lizelle Lee (29) and Dane van Niekerk put on a 79-run stand. Van Niekerk then combined well with Marizanne Kapp (22) to take their side into triple figures, with the former reaching a quicker than a run-a-ball 50, eventually finishing her innings on 62. The Australians though took four key middle-order wickets to reel in their opponents before Suné Luus contributed 11 runs to take her team to 147/6. In reply, Australia Women were rocked by early wickets as Kapp led the charge with a fiery opening spell. The all-rounder removed three of the top five batters while Nonkululeko Mlaba’s (1/19) left the defending T20 champions struggling on 35/4. Meg Lanning (47) and Rachael Haynes (39) then put on 83 as the pair proceeded to take the game away from the visitors. Kapp took 4/16 but it wasn’t enough as Australia chased down the total with 3 balls to spare. South Africa will kick off their T20 World Cup campaign on Sunday, 23 February with a Pool B clash against England at the WACA in Perth. The tournament itself gets underway on Friday, with the hosts taking on India.
