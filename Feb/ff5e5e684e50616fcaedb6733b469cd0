The 36-year-old will don Proteas colours for the first time since March last year when South Africa and England continue their rivalry in the first of three T20’s on Wednesday. JOHANNESBURG - Proteas seamer Dale Steyn said he was relishing the chance to play for South Africa again. The 36-year-old will don Proteas colours for the first time since March last year when South Africa and England continue their rivalry in the first of three T20s on Wednesday. Steyn retired from Test cricket last year after a number of injuries but still made it clear that he wanted to continue in the limited-overs formats. The experienced fast bowler will be part of a new look Proteas team with several new faces in the T20 squad, including the likes of Pite van Biljon and Sisanda Magala. Steyn said it’s good to see fresh players in the side. “It's always good to come back into this dressing room. There's some different faces around and new players as well, which is quite nice because I played against a lot of these guys in the MSL and got to know a lot of them, especially the younger guys. I'm pretty pleased to be back here,’ he said. With a fairly inexperienced attack, Steyn is hoping to be the one that the youngsters turn to on the field and in the dressing room. “This is a very young group of players and I think my role when I come into the side now is to do well. I want to perform but I want to be able to orchestrate the bowling line-up a little bit and guide them. Hopefully they can learn and get better every game, whilst I'm there so that's kind of what I want to do with the team”, he said.
