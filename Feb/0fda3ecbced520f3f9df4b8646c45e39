CAPE TOWN - The Stormers confirmed that Springbok hooker Bongi Mbonambi may miss the rest of the season after undergoing surgery for a hamstring injury. It was initially thought the World Cup winner would only be sidelined for two to three weeks but now he could miss South Africa's games against Scotland and Georgia in July 2020. Stormers coach John Dobson said that Mbonambi was currently in hospital and said that the situation was severe. "Bongi is going to be out for a significant amount of time. He had an operation on his hamstring. The first time we weren't pushing, we thought it was just a tear. Then the scan revealed a bigger tear then it later revealed it's detached from the bone," said Dobson. "His situation is severe. I doubt he'll play Super Rugby this season but we will communicate it further once we know all the facts." The Stormers play the Lions this weekend on the third round of the Super Rugby.
