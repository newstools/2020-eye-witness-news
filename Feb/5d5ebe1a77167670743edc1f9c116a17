The City of Tshwane's mayor Stevens Mokgalapa has announced his resignation JOHANNESBURG - The City of Tshwane's mayor Stevens Mokgalapa has announced he is resigning before the end of this month. In December, Mokgalapa was removed through a motion of no confidence. However, the High Court in Pretoria ruled that all decisions made at that council sitting which removed him must be set aside pending the outcome of an urgent review of the proceedings. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has said it would decide on Mokgalapa's future as Tshwane mayor in January. It all started with an audio recording, where Mokgalapa could be heard making disparaging remarks to Senkubuge about his colleagues in the party. Media reports of Mokgalapa allegedly having sex with Senkubuge also emerged - further fueling the matters in the da office. Mokgalapa took special leave shortly after this and the DA launched an investigation into his conduct. On Sunday morning, he announced his resignation saying it is to put the people of Tshwane first. DA Gauteng leader John Moodey said it's the honourable thing to do and that the party has welcomed Mokgalapa's decision.
