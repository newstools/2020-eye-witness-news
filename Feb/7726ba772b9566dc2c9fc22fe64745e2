Calvin Marlin was part of the very first Ajax Cape Town squad back in 1999. CAPE TOWN - Ajax Cape Town have on Wednesday announced it will retain Calvin Marlin as interim head coach of the club until the end of the 2019/20 GladAfrica Championship season. Marlin was part of the very first Ajax Cape Town squad back in 1999. The 43-year-old returned to the Urban Warriors as an assistant coach to Muhsin Ertuğral in December 2017 and later became assistant to Andries Ulderink. The former SuperSport United and Mamelodi Sundowns goalkeeper will remain in charge of the team until the end of the season along with Dylan Deane as his assistant. “I’m just focused on the training, to be honest, I’m glad the management hasn’t pressed the panic button to sign a coach at this point of the season,” said Marlin. “We as the technical staff know what it will mean if we win the league because we are the ones that experienced the bizarre relegation and it means so much more to us. The management have shown trust in us and we are here to win! Ajax is a huge part of me and I will do what I can to show that to the fans,” he concluded. Ajax Cape Town next faces Jomo Cosmos at Olen Park in Potchefstroom on Sunday.
