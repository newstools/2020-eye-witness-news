ANC Gauteng leaders have gathered at the St Gorges hotel in Irene on Sunday at the party's assembly of cadres.  The event is to give feedback on the organisational priorities as outlined in the January 8th statement.  The party says the da has failed to improve service delivery in Tshwane. Its chairperson David Makhura said, “We have exposed the complete collapse of governance and administration led by the Democratic Alliance there. It’s not enough. We don’t celebrate when there is not service delivery. We want service delivery in that City. We want to see things developing and improving.” “The ANC doesn’t want power at all cost in Tshwane. We are not desperate, and let me tell you we are not going to hand over power. We are not going to use our bones to bring someone else.” the ANC has also been battling issues of factionalism and corruption within the organisation.Makhura says this must come to an end. “We must confront the demon of factionalism, and the demon of corruption.”
