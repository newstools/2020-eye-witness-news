JOHANNESBURG - Traffic has come to a standstill in the Sandton CBD as a result of a protest march by hundreds of EFF members. Protesters are heading to Megawatt Park to hand over a memorandum to Eskom officials. They are protesting against load shedding and the privitasation of the utility. Several streets in the Sandton CBD have been completely blocked off to traffic as a large crowed of EFF members slowly head to the utility’s headquarters to hand over their memorandum of demands. Earlier EFF leader Julius Malema addressed the crowd. “So Jamnadas until the grave. We don’t care what racists say. Down with Jamnadas, down. Down with Cyril Ramaphosa, down.” Jamnadas is the middle name of Public Enterprises Minister Parvin Gordhan, whom the EFF has repeatedly demanded be fired. #EFFEskomMarch Malema addresses the growing crowd.
