TSHWANE - The Tshwane council special meeting that was due to discuss a motion of no confidence against Democratic Alliance (DA) office bearers has been postponed indefinitely. The meeting was convened by Speaker Katlego Mathebe following four failed attempts to hold such a sitting. Previous meetings were requested by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which accused the DA of failing residents. Yet another special council meeting intended to discuss a motion of no confidence against DA office bearers has failed to materialise. African National Congress (ANC) and EFF councillors boycotted the sitting and as a result, councillors failed to secure a quorum as Mathebe explained. By law, 107 plus one councillor had to be present in the chambers for the meeting to go ahead. They were supposed to discuss a motion of no confidence against the outgoing Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa followed by that of the acting Speaker Zweli Khumalo, chair of chairs and one against the Speaker herself. The ANC is expected to clarify why its members were not present today.
