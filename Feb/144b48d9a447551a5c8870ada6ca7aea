The National Prosecuting Authority's Natasha Kara said: “The matter was set down for a bail application today, however, the accused abandoned his bail application and the matter was remanded to March for further investigations. The accused will remain in custody.” The Durban LGBTIQ community centre's Sibonelo Khumalo has welcomed Tuesday’s court proceedings.
