The country has issued a level four travel advisory, warning residents not to travel to China, adding that most commercial air carriers have reduced or suspended flights to and from the country. And Vietnam has confirmed an additional case of the virus in the province of Vinh Phuc, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to eight. China’s ambassador to South Africa Lin Songtian has questioned the manner in which some countries are responding to the coronavirus outbreak. Lin said together with the world, China could stop the coronavirus. He said South Africans stuck in China were safe and well taken care of. “The specialised hospital is already there. I think it’s best for people to stay there.” In a bid to prevent the spread of the deadly virus, several countries have evacuated their citizens from Wuhan and others have gone as far as preventing Chinese nationals from entering their territories. Lin stressed the importance of China’s economy, calling on all countries to stand together to help China fight the outbreak. Last week, South Africans working in Wuhan criticised the government for not evacuating them. WATCH: 'It's a ghost town': South Africans in Wuhan describe coronavirus lockdown
