With the disappointment of the T20 series defeat to Australia still fresh, Proteas captain Quinton de Kock said that the team had an honest conversation about fighting back and chasing scores, something they were failing to do of late. CAPE TOWN - With Australia claiming T20I series against South Africa at Newlands on Wednesday night, the teams will now prepare for the first one-day international to be played at Boland Park in Paarl on Saturday. With the disappointment of the series defeat still fresh, Proteas captain Quinton de Kock said that the team had an honest conversation about fighting back and chasing scores, something they were failing to do of late. The Proteas lost to Australia by 97 runs in the deciding T20 after being bowled out for 96 chasing Australia's 193. De Kock said that this was the right time to give younger players an opportunity as the side was in a rebuilding phase. "I think obviously now it's a better time to give some of the younger players an opportunity. Of course, the ODI World Cup is still far away, I think when we start rebuilding our ODI team there has to be time and we have to start somewhere," said de Kock. "I am asking a lot of advice from Faf [du Plessis], so I am still learning. I will get better with the results going forward." De Kock said they have to do better in fighting back. "We had an honest conversation about fighting back, especially playing against the Aussie team - they're a really strong team," he said. "They are on top and they're hard to stop. We spoke about not giving them a sniff. Unfortunately, they got a sniff and they rode away."
