CAPE TOWN - Jaco Visagie and Johnny Kotze will both run out for their 50th Super Rugby caps against the Blues when the Bulls return to Loftus Versfeld for the first time this season on Saturday. Visagie made his tournament debut for the Bulls back in 2015 and has proven to be a regular fixture in any given matchday squad while Kotze made his debut in the colours of the Stormers in 2015 before moving north. Bulls head coach Pote Human has selected a relatively unchanged team with Wian Vosloo the only new face in the starting lineup. He takes over the No.7 jumper from Abongile Nonkontwana. The bench sees two changes with Corniel Els and Ruan Steenkamp making their first appearances this season. Els replaces the injured Johan Grobbelaar while Steenkamp takes Vosloo's place on the bench. "I've played with Jaco and Johnny for several seasons and they're quality players who deserve this accolade. It's not an easy feat to achieve 50 caps in Super Rugby but their commitment and determination have been the cornerstone of their playing careers," said Bulls captain Burger Odendaal. "The team already wants to claim a win for our loyal Bulls family and now we have an added incentive." Bulls: 15. Warrick Gelant, 14. Cornal Hendricks, 13. Johnny Kotze, 12. Burger Odendaal (c), 11. Rosko Specman, 10. Morné Steyn, 9. Ivan van Zyl, 8. Josh Strauss, 7. Wian Vosloo, 6. Jeandré Rudolph, 5. Juandré Kruger, 4. Andries Ferreira, 3. Trevor Nyakane, 2. Jaco Visagie, 1. Lizo Gqoboka.
