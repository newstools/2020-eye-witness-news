FW de Klerk was labelled an apartheid apologist by the EFF following a recent interview he did with the SABC. JOHANNESBURG - Former President Nelson Mandela’s daughter Zindzi  Mandela took to Twitter on Friday morning, saying she was heartbroken about what happened to her mother and many others under FW de Klerk’s watch during apartheid. De Klerk was labelled an apartheid apologist by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) following a recent interview he did with the SABC. The United Nations (UN) proclaimed that apartheid was a crime against humanity. However, during that interview with the public broadcaster De Klerk said he did not fully agree with the UN’s statement. “I am not justifying apartheid in any way whatsoever… I profusely apologised for that but there is a difference between calling something a crime – genocide is a crime – apartheid cannot be [a crime against humanity]. More people died because of black-on-black violence than because of apartheid,” De Klerk told the SABC. _WATCH: FW de Klerk’s SABC interview _  Zindzi Mandela tweeted a photo of her mother Winnie Madikizela Mandela being handled by white police officers during apartheid.
