The details of his crimes have not yet been confirmed by authorities. The missing girl’s mother, Carmen van Wyk, has many questions. “Why my daughter? I’ve heard that he’s obsessed with her. I heard he was talking to her. Why and how does one do that?” The girl’s father, Terrence Manuel, said he was trying his best to keep a brave face for his family. “I feel like there’s nothing I can do as a father. I can’t even go out and search for her due to gang violence.” Authorities are following up on leads in several areas in efforts to find the eight-year-old girl.
