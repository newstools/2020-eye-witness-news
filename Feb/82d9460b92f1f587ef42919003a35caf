David Van Boven and Tasliem Ambrose were in the Bellville Magistrates Court on Wednesday morning. CAPE TOWN - The case against two men implicated in the murder of a young Cape Town woman and her grandfather has been postponed. David Van Boven and Tasliem Ambrose were in the Bellville Magistrates Court on Wednesday morning. Jesse Hess, a 19-year-old UWC student, and her grandfather Chris Lategan were found dead in their Parow flat in August.  Van Boven and Ambrose will return to the dock on 8 April. Detectives need more time to finalise their investigation. A DNA report is still outstanding. The defence has questioned why the delay is needed, pointing out the matter dates back to August last year. Itâ€™s requested this be the final postponement. Magistrate Charles Scott turned down the request, explaining the case is new and has only been on the roll since mid-November. Van Boven, a distant relative of Hess, and Ambrose each face two charges of murder and two charges of aggravated robbery. Further charges may be added at a later stage.
