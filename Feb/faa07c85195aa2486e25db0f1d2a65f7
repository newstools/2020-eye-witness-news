Speaker of the provincial legislature Nontembeko Boyce said an invitation was extended to the former president and all political parties agreed to his participation. DURBAN - Former President Jacob Zuma  may participate at KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala’s State of the Province of Address (Sopa) next week Wednesday. However, his participation is dependent on whether he is healthy enough to do so. Speaker of the provincial legislature Nontembeko Boyce said an invitation was extended to the former president and all political parties agreed to his participation. “The office of the premier has informed us that he will be attending, health permitting." Last year, Zuma’s presence at the opening of the legislature caused a stir as he was seated among members of the House. The Economic Freedom Fighters and the Democratic Alliance  staged a walkout, accusing the House of breaching its own rules to accommodate the former statesman. Officials said they hoped to avoid this problem this year by ensuring the proper demarcation of seating arrangements.
