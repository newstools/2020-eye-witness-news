JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Department of Basic Education has confirmed two more pupils have died in the province bringing the number of reported deaths to seven in the past week. It's understood a 17-year-old pupil from the Oosrand Secondary School was assaulted on Saturday by passengers in a taxi. She jumped off while the vehicle was moving in Germiston and died on the scene. While in another incident, which also happened over the weekend, an eight-year-old pupil from Durban Deep Primary School was swept away by flash floods at the Princess informal settlement in Roodepoort.
