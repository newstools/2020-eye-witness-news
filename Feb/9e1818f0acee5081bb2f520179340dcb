The power utility said rolling blackouts would continue until 6 am on Wednesday. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom Eskom's plan to suspend load shedding to ease traffic congestion has been canned. On Monday, the power utility announced it would run a pilot programme to halt rolling blackouts during the morning and afternoon peak hours. The experiment was to be implemented between 6 am and 9 am as well as between 4 pm and 6 pm. That has proven to be unsustainable, as Eskom has now pulled the plug because of breakdowns at some units. The power utility's Sikonathi Mantshantsha said: “We will carry on with load shedding until 6 am on Wednesday morning.”
