However, the utility has warned its aging infrastructure remained unstable - meaning the situation could change at short notice. The company said that the power grid remained vulnerable and has urged consumers to switch off any unnecessary appliances. Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshanthsa: "We've now managed to limit our unplanned breakdowns to just over 10,500MW - these are the station that just break without any notice and of course we have repaired quite a few units that were out on planned maintenance."
