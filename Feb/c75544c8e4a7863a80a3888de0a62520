Organisers have added an extra two kilometres to the 56km event. CAPE TOWN - Runners can expect a change on this year's Two Oceans Marathon after organisers confirmed that this year's ultra marathon would be run over a distance of approximately 58 kilometres. Organisers have added an extra two kilometres to the 56km event. The unprecedented growth in road running in South Africa over the past decade has resulted in increasing concern for the safety of runners. Various dangers associated with the congestion on Cape Townâ€™s roads during the race over the Easter Weekend, particularly on the Saturday during normal business hours, have been identified by City of Cape Town officials. "The Two Oceans Marathon NPC has been collaborating closely with all city authorities and stakeholders to mitigate the risks for participants and to find a workable solution, which will include small changes to the TOM Ultra Marathon route," said the race statement. "The new route will add approximately 2 kilometres to the distance but runners can be assured that medal and finish cut-off times will be increased accordingly. The Half Marathon route remains unchanged. Final details about the exact TOM 2020 Ultra Marathon route for 11 April 2020 will be announced soon."
