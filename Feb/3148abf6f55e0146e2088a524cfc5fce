They were accused of having extorted the Grand Cafe in Table Bay harbour, demanding R90,000 from them for protection services. CAPE TOWN - Four men accused of running a protection racket have been acquitted of extortion. Nafiz Modack, Colin Booysen and two others were accused of extorting the Grand Cafe in Table Bay harbour out of R90,000 in November 2017. At the time, there were reports of fighting between two factions for control of security at Cape Town restaurants and nightclubs. In a lengthy judgment, Magistrate Byron Pedro found there was no evidence proving the Grande Cafe was extorted by Modack and his co-accused.    In fact, Pedro ruled that the evidence proved the meeting during which the extra R90,000 for security was agreed to in November 2017, was a business negotiation. He has therefore acquitted Modack, Colin Booysen, Ashley Fields and Jacques Cronje on all charges which include extortion, money laundering and rendering a security service without being a registered provider. The four men were visibly relieved after the proceedings concluded after more than two years. They were escorted out of court by bodyguards.
