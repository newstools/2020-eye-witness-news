Myeni has finally taken the witness stand in her defence in the case brought against her by outa and the SA Pilots Association. PRETORIA - Former South African Airways (SAA) board chair Dudu Myeni on Thursday denied that during her tenure at the airline, she would frequently give instructions to the entity executives and the board. Myeni has finally taken the witness stand in her defence in the case brought against her by Outa and the SA Pilots Association. They want her to be declared a delinquent director. Myeni disputed the majority of allegations levelled against her; she's also been blamed for the collapse of a R1.5 billion deal with Emirates. But Myeni said that was not the case. “It deflates me to hear that an executive, who actually older than me, would come and lie in the court… or state things that are not factual.” Earlier a witness said Myeni was taking decisions unilaterally, but she denied this: “The chair of the board’s responsibility starts and ends with the board and then we facilitate a meeting between the board and the executives through the chairman and the CEO.” She is now explaining the role she played in another failed purchase of new A3-30 aircraft. NOT TO BLAMED FOR FAILED BILLION RAND DEAL Myeni has told the High Court in Pretoria that she could not be blamed for the failed multimillion-rand deal between SAA and Emirates. When the trial began, former acting CEO Nico Bezuidenhout testified that Myeni was responsible for SAA losing a major deal with Emirates worth R1.5 billion. However, Myeni said this was a lie: “If I were to write to the executives, it means that I am getting into the terrain of the CEO.” Bezuidenhout’s testimony was supported by other former executives. Myeni has wrapped up her testimony. When the trial resumes on Friday, she will be cross-examined by Outa’s counsel.
