Some residents said they were angry about electricity issues, while others were adamant they wanted their ward councillor removed. JOHANNESBURG - Tensions were high in Klipspruit, Soweto on Tuesday morning where residents barricaded roads with burning tyres and rocks. Some residents said they were angry about electricity issues, while others were adamant they wanted their ward councillor removed. One resident said they were tired of being left out when it came to service delivery. “The councillor has been serving for more than 20 years. During [former President Nelson] Mandela’s time she was a proportional representation councillor and she went on to become a full councillor during former President Thabo Mbeki’s presidency. So, it’s not about electricity but the incompetence of the councillor,” he said. Another Klipspruit resident said: “We want our councillor Zodwa Nxumalo to step down. Everybody knows her and she has never done anything for us and we want service delivery.” Several roads were inaccessible for motorists and included Chris Hani Road, Moroka Nancefield Road, and Klipspruit Valley Road. At the same time, Rea Vaya buses in Soweto were suspended following the demonstrations in Klipspruit.  Klipspruit councillor Zodwa Nxumalo said that the allegations of poor service delivery leveled against her by the community were unfounded. Nxumalo said that the protest was being led by a handful of disgruntled people. "They did not follow the correct route and all these allegations are unfounded. It's not about service delivery, let me put it straight to you. There is a guy that is supposed to be evicted... he connived with these people saying that they must help to him not get evicted."
