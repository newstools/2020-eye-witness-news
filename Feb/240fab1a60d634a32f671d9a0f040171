CAPE TOWN/JOHANNESBURG - The Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation says it's "irresponsible" for the FW de Klerk Foundation to debate the degree of apartheid sin. This comes after the Economic Freedom Fighters  labelled former president FW de Klerk a "man with blood on his hands" and an "unrepentant apartheid apologist" during President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address. In an interview with the SABC, De Klerk, apologised for apartheid, but said he does not believe it can be labelled a crime.  In a statement, the FW de Klerk Foundation reiterated the former statesman's position that apartheid was not a crime against humanity. The foundation says it's not trying to whitewash the injustices that were undoubtedly committed under apartheid, but there needs to be a balanced understanding of the past. ANC leaders have called on the foundation to unconditionally retract the statement.
