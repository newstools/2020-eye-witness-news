The Lesotho Communications Authority confirmed that it slapped Vodacom with an R8.2 million penalties for failing to pay regulatory fees on time. JOHANNESBURG - The Vodacom  head office in South Africa on Tuesday weighed in on threats by Lesotho to revoke its subsidiary's licence there. The Lesotho Communications Authority confirmed that it slapped Vodacom with an R8.2 million penalties for failing to pay regulatory fees on time and said the South African firm had 90 days to explain why it should keep its license. The Mountain Kingdom's regulator said the mobile giant had not only failed to appoint independent auditors but had also failed to report back on connecting internet in schools. But, Vodacom group head of media relations Byron Kennedy said Vodacom was co-operating with the regulator. “Vodacom Group is aware of regulatory concerns affecting its Lesotho business relating to a perceived conflict of interest and timeous payment of regulatory fees. Vodacom Lesotho has made written communication to the Lesotho Communications Authority regarding all these concerns and will continue to engage meaningfully with the view to find common ground with the LCA in the interest of our customers, our stakeholders and the broader Lesotho community.”
