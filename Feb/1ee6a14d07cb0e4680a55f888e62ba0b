The former DA Youth Leader has been addressing a press briefing in Rosebank, announcing her candidacy to contest the position of national leader. JOHANNESBURG - Mbali Ntuli on Friday said the Democratic Alliance (DA)'s current leadership was failing to steer the party in the right direction. The former DA Youth Leader has been addressing a press briefing in Rosebank, announcing her candidacy to contest the position of national leader. Ntuli penned a letter to party representatives, describing the DA as being in a deep crisis and permanent state of damage control.  It comes after Mmusi Maimane unceremoniously resigned as DA leader last year. Ntuli is expected to go head to head with Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela, Gauteng leader John Moodey and interim leader John Steenhuisen amongst others. BRINGING FAIRNESS BACK TO DA Ntuli said she wanted to bring fairness back to the organisation. She said she was confident that she had the backing of party members to lead the organisation. The former KwaZulu-Natal member of the provincial legislature said the DA needed to lead from a place of empathy: “I want to clear up, once and for all, the confusion about who we are and who we stand for and who we fight for.” She said part of her decision to run was rooted in the fact that she was a black South African woman. “I’ve worked on the ground and I understand what it is to work in townships and in rural areas and build structures and grassroots organisation.” Ntuli said the DA should return focus to realigning politics in South Africa.
