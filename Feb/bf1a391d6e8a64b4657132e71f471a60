CAPE TOWN - The Two Oceans Marathon have announced that it has been awarded Gold Label Status by the International Association of Ultrarunners (IAU). The race is aligned to the IAU that operates under the patronage of World Athletics. The IAU is dedicated to developing ultra-distance running internationally within the rules and regulations of Athletics South Africa (ASA) and WA. As the international governing body for ultra-distance running, one of its main objectives is to promote and develop ultra-distance running worldwide by encouraging specific activities in each of the IAU Continental Areas. Every year events are required to submit an application to the IAU and based on the evaluation of these submissions, events are designated as bronze, silver or gold status. The IAU introduced the IAU labelling in 2008, to ensure that all ultra marathon routes are measured to conform to World Athletics (IAAF) regulations. This is especially important when a world or continental best performance is run, as it is the only way best performances can be compared. Only performances in the IAU labelled races will be recognised officially by the IAU and World Athletics. “We are extremely proud to have been re-awarded IAU Gold Label Status for the 2020 Two Oceans Marathon. The IAU Gold Label Status aligns the Two Oceans Marathon with the world’s leading ultra-marathons," said race director for the Two Oceans Marathon Debra Barnes. "Not only is the IAU Gold Label Status a most welcome confirmation of the global prestige of our event, but this endorsement is also an acknowledgement of the contributions of our stakeholders, sponsors, partners and our runners in making the world’s most beautiful ultramarathon possible.” The 2019 Two Oceans Marathon was granted Gold Label Status by the IAU in February last year.
