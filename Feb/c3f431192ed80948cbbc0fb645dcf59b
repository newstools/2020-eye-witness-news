JOHANNESBURG - The Soweto electricity crisis committee said that it was planning to shut down the township during the State of the Province Address and the national Budget Speech this week. The committee held a public rally in Rockville on Sunday to challenge their R18 billion electricity bill from Eskom. The power utility has cut off supply to various parts of Soweto due to non-payment. Residents were now planning the shutdown aimed at pressuring government into lowering electricity fees which they said that they could not afford. The committee's Trevor Ngwane: "We demand that the ANC government puts pressure on Eskom to treat communities equally. Then secondly, we are going to shut down on Budget day, we want the Budget to favour the poor and favour the working class."
