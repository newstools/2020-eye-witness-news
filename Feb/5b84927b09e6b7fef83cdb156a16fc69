Low economic growth means not enough tax revenue to cover government spending, sending debt levels soaring. Cyril Ramaphosa said that too much state spending was on consumption and interest on debt, rather than investments in infrastructure. "We cannot continue along this path nor can we afford to stand still." He said Mboweni would outline steps to cut government spending and make it more efficient in his Budget Speech later this month. "We are engaged with labour and other stakeholders on measures we need to take to contain the public wage bill and reduce wastage." Ramaphosa said that a key priority for this year was fixing commuter rail services, with R1.4 billion to be invested in both Cape Town’s Central Line and Pretoria’s Mabopane Line.
