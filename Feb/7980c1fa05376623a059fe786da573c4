Lungi Ngidi produced a match-winning performance at the death to help the Proteas defeat England by just one run in the first T20 international at Buffalo Park, East London. CAPE TOWN - Proteas fast bowler Lungi Ngidi has commended his match confidence for Proteas victory over England on Wednesday night. Ngidi produced a match-winning performance at the death to help the Proteas defeat England by just one run in the first T20 international at Buffalo Park, East London. The Proteas defended their total of 177/8 in 20 overs, thanks to Ngidiâ€™s final two overs in which he took three wickets for just 10 runs. Ngidi believes he's on the right path to regaining his match fitness and confidence to do what he's known for. "I guess it's a mental thing to be able to finish off well in situations that require you to, it does take a lot from your mental side,'' said Ngidi. "Physically, of course, I'm trying as best as I can to get back to the pace that I was at - to hit the areas I'm known for hitting. At the moment, I'm just trying to keep that confidence in doing my job at the back end going and closing up very well."
