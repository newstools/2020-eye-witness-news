Production in the sector plummeted by almost 6% year-on-year in December. CAPE TOWN - The South African manufacturing sector has seen its seventh consecutive month of annual growth declines. Production in the sector plummeted by almost 6% year-on-year in December. This is the biggest drop in the sector in recent months. FNB senior economist Geoff Notling said: “All manufacturing divisions recorded negative growth in December. The largest detractors, which were motor vehicles parts and accessories, declined by 24.9% year-on-year while petroleum and chemical products declined by 5.9% year-on-year.” He said load shedding contributed towards the contraction: “What we found with our models is that electricity output declined and so did manufacturing. The occurrence of stage 2 load shedding certainly detracted manufacturing output.”
