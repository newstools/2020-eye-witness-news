CAPE TOWN - The Sharks have named Boeta Chamberlain at flyhalf in place of Curwin Bosch, who has returned to South Africa due to deal with a family bereavement, for their Super Rugby clash against the Hurricanes in Wellington on Saturday. Sharks head coach Sean Everitt has selected a pack-heavy bench with six forwards and just two backs in anticipation of the physical battle against the hosts. “Preparations for the game on Saturday have gone well and the guys are enjoying Wellington,” said Everitt. "We’re hoping for more of the same from last week if the weather allows it. It looks like it’s going to remain the same which is good, and we can then look to unleashing our backs again." Sharks:15.
