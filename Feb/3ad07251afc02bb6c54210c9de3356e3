In 2016, the Russian admitted she had failed a drug test in Australia due to the detection of meldonium. JOHANNESBURG - Maria Sharapova has on Wednesday announced her retirement from tennis after winning five Grand Slams. In an interview with Vanity Fair, the Russian said: “In giving my life to tennis, tennis gave me a life. I’ll miss it every day. I’ll miss the training and my daily routine: waking up at dawn, lacing my left shoe before my right, and closing the court’s gate before I hit my first ball of the day. I’ll miss my team, my coaches. I’ll miss the moments sitting with my father on the practice court bench. The handshakes - win or lose - and the athletes, whether they knew it or not, who pushed me to be my best." Taking to her social media, Sharapova posted a picture of herself in her younger days and captioned it: “Tennis showed me the world - and it showed me what I was made of. It’s how I tested myself and how I measured my growth. And so in whatever I might choose for my next chapter, my next mountain, I’ll still be pushing. I’ll still be climbing. I’ll still be growing. Tennis - I’m saying goodbye.” Tennis showed me the world—and it showed me what I was made of. It’s how I tested myself and how I measured my growth. And so in whatever I might choose for my next chapter, my next mountain, I’ll still be pushing. I’ll still be climbing. I’ll still be growing. Tennis—I’m saying goodbye.
