CAPE TOWN - Former Australian captain Steve Smith is back in the country for the first time since the ball-tampering scandal two years ago in Cape Town. Smith was at the centre of the scandal that rocked Australian cricket and game at large - fellow batsmen Cameron Bancroft and David Warner were also involved. Smith and Warner were banned by Cricket Australia for 12 months from international and domestic cricket for their roles in the tampering scandal, while Bancroft was banned for 9 months. Smith said that although a lot happened in 2018 in Cape Town, he was happy to be back and had learnt a lot from his mistakes. "It's nice to be back and play here in South Africa. Obviously, the last time I was here things didn't end well but I've also got some fond memories of playing here. I think in 2014, the Test series we played here was amazing and also winning the champions league at the Wanderers," said Smith. "Walking into the hotel in Sandton, I was like: 'The last time I left here, it wasn't pretty'. It wasn't the best time of my life but I've moved on from that and learnt a lot from the past two years." He said that he was looking forward to the limited-overs series against South Africa. "I'm looking forward to the series, it's going to be a very good one. South Africa played some very good games against England, although they didn't win, they play very well," said Smith. "I think they've got few players who are coming back, so I know it will be a terrific series." South Africa and Australia play the first of their three matches in the Twenty20 format at the Wanderers on Friday before the series moves to Port Elizabeth and Newlands respectively. The two sides will also battle it out in a three-match ODI series from 29 February to 7 March 2020.
