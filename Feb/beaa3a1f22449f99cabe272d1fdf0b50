The 20-year-old loose-forward served a one-week suspension he was handed for a dangerous tackle in the match against the Cheetahs earlier this month. CAPE TOWN - The Southern Kings No.8 Elrigh Louw will make a return when the side takes on Scarlets in a PRO14 clash at Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli, Wales on Sunday. The 20-year-old loose-forward served a one-week suspension he was handed for a dangerous tackle in the match against the Cheetahs earlier this month. Louw will this weekend return to the starting XV in the only personnel change to the forward's pack that did duty in Cork a week ago. Bobby de Wee makes way for Louw as he starts this weekend’s match on the bench, as Ruaan Lerm, who earned his 50th cap playing at No.8 last week, shifts to the blindside flank. Howard Mnisi has been included as the starting inside centre this weekend where he will form an exciting midfield partnership with the equally experienced Sibusiso Sithole. Erich Louw, who wore the No.12 jersey a week ago, shifts to the left-wing as Eddie Ludick, who made his debut last weekend, moves to provide cover from the bench. Courtney Winnaar has also been handed a starting berth – this time at fullback, where he replaces Andell Loubser. Also returning from a four-week suspension is Pieter Scholtz. He will provide front row cover from the bench. Southern Kings: 15. Courtney Winnaar, 14. Christopher Hollis, 13. Sibusiso Sithole, 12. Howard Mnisi, 11. Howard Mnisi, 10. Demetri Catrakilis, 9.
