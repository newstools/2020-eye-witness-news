CAPE TOWN – Parliament’s transport portfolio committee chairperson Mosebenzi Zwane said the Western Cape rail system’s power should not have been cut by Eskom  on Thursday. Zwane said it was unfortunate to involve ordinary people in matters they knew nothing about. Tens of thousands of Metrorail train commuters were left stranded on Thursday for hours at platforms when Eskom cut power to Cape Town’s entire rail network. The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) failed to settle its electricity bill with the power utility. Power was eventually restored after the rail operator paid up. #WC_Trains Commuters have been told to take alternative transport this afternoon. Eskom has cut its power due to non-payment.

"I've explained that this is a broken place that we are reconstructing. So it's not a place that is easy. It's not like when the lights go off and we can't explain. I'm a minister and I've got to explain. I'm responsible for Prasa," he said. Additional reporting by Kevin Brandt.
