The Joburg council was expected to sit on Thursday in line with the speaker’s objectives of fast-tracking service delivery. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA)’s Joburg regional chairperson Funzi Ngobeni will face the city’s ethics and disciplinary committee after he called Mayor Geoff Makhubo a liar. The Joburg council was expected to sit on Thursday in line with the speaker’s objectives of fast-tracking service delivery. Makhubo based his acceptance speech on service delivery in the city making familiar promises including water and sanitation in informal settlements. But, Ngobeni challenged the appointment of new council Speaker Nonceba Molwele. He also questioned Makhubo’s views on the city’s electricity crisis. “You are saying that there must be a [electricity] flat rate in Soweto. It's very important that you would have to do that because you are the mayor. You can't say others must pay this amount and others must pay that amount... it also speaks to the fact that because you're the mayor you have to represent us to the investors as well. Please don't go around telling lies about the city's finances,” Ngobeni said at the time. Molwele asked Ngobeni to withdraw the word liar but he refused. The speaker referred Ngobeni to the city’s ethics and disciplinary committee.
