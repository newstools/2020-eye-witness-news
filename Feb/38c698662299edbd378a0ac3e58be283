The fine has been suspended for 2 years or 5 years behind bars if he commits another crime. JOHANNESBURG - Adam Catzavelos on Friday was given a suspended sentence of R50 000 or two years in jail for his racist remarks on a Greek beach. Catzavelos appeared in the Randburg Magistrates Court on Friday morning where the ruling was handed down. Should he commit another crimen injuria crime, Catzavelos would need to pay the fine or go to jail. He was convicted of crimen injuria  after pleading guilty to making racists comments while on a beach in Greece. He filmed himself celebrating the absence of black people on the beach in a rant that quickly went viral, which sparked fury in South Africa. Catzavelos said he was relieved by the ruling. “I’m very grateful that I had a very fair and reasonable judge,” he said. Catzavelos would still have to comply with a settlement he reached out of court with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), where he was ordered to pay R150,000 to the Seth Mazibuko Foundation in Soweto. The SAHRC intended to take Catzavelos to the Equality Court over the incident. In her judgment, Magistrate Hleziphi Mkhasibe also considered submissions made by the Economic Freedom Fighters  who accepted the ruling but highlighted the need for racism to be considered a crime. This means if he commits the crime of crimen injuria tomorrow, the court can imposed the fine or he faces 2 years in jail. However, the provision of a fine falls away if the crime is committed again say in 6 years’ time. Nonetheless, this conviction will still be considered. AN
