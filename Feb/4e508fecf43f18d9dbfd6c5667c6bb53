CAPE TOWN - Stormers head coach John Dobson said that they were expecting a physical battle against the Jaguares when they meet at Newlands in their Super Rugby clash on Saturday. Dobson said the Argentinian side would try to prove a point at Newlands knowing that it's their last time visiting the venue. The Stormers have won all of their matches in the campaign so far and he knows this weekend's game is big. "I think they're physical, they're direct and if they use it they'll gain momentum. They have a couple of really good players. So with them, it will be a physical battle, no doubt about it," said Dobson. "It's a very big game for us in terms of confidence, in terms of our pride and in terms of getting hyped up... we've got two wins at home. Our ball security is a big thing for us going to this match. "As much as it is a motivation for us, it might backfire you know. It's such a special game but I think the Argentinians have a great history playing here." The Stormers are going into Saturday's clash with injury-free, having only the long-term injuries of hooker Bongi Mbonambi and captain Siya Kolisi. The fitness of prop Wilco Louw, who sprained his ankle in their win over the Lions, will be decided on Thursday.
