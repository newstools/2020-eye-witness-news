CAPE TOWN - A second coronavirus (COVID-19)  infection on Thursday has been confirmed in Cape Town’s densely populated Khayelitsha township. Western Cape Premier Alan Winde revealed this during a briefing on Thursday. There were now 393 infections in the province. Besides the second case in Khayelitsha, Mitchells Plain had seven infections and the Klipfontein region had nine. The Western Cape’s Health Department head Dr Keith Cloete said: “In Khayelitsha, we have two cases, in Mitchells Plain there are seven cases, and in Klipfontein we have nine cases, but it’s still the areas with the least cases. Our concern is that we might be having community transmission in those areas.” Cloete said 164 cases were locally transmitted.
