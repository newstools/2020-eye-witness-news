The group said consumers would not be affected by the closure. Spokesperson Nevashnie Naicker said: “Our bread manufacturing process is highly automated all the way from mixing to baking to slicing. We have also put in place specific protocols to mitigate any environmental or surface contamination in the event of a positive COVID-19 case.” Naicker said the food manufacturing group was guided by research from the Health Department and the National Institute of Communicable Diseases to ensure that they deliver safe food for consumption by customers. Naicker has stressed that there is currently no indication that the coronavirus is transmitted through food.
