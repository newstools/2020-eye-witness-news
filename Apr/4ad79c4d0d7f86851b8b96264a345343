The facility was closed after a nurse tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19). DUDUZA – Some residents of Duduza in Nigel, Ekurhuleni, on Thursday expressed concern about the closure of one of the local clinics in the area. The facility was closed after a nurse tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19). She contracted the virus after attending a church gathering in Bloemfontein last month. Members of the public in Duduza said there were four clinics and the closure of one of them posed a serious challenge as they now had to walk kilometres to get help. “I think it will be a problem because the clinic is here and close to our homes,” said one resident. Another added: “It’s going to be quite a challenge for us.” Some residents appeared to be adhering to the lockdown with only a few people seen walking on the streets. Meanwhile, there was a long queue at the local Shoprite store with people not adhering to social distancing. Taxis were also operating as normal with the one seen carrying a full load and disregarding the 70% load regulation. Only a few passengers had masks and latex hand gloves.
