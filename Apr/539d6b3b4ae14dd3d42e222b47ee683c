CAPE TOWN - Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has paid a R1,000 admission of guilt fine for contravening lockdown regulations. This after a photograph of her having lunch with former Higher Education deputy minister Mduduzi Manana caused an uproar on social media last month. That resulted in the president putting her on special leave and docking her a month’s salary. According to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), investigations revealed that the visit was not for purposes of rendering essential service or obtaining essential goods, collecting a grant or seeking medical attention as per the requirements of the COVID-19 lockdown regulations. Despite paying the fine, Ndabeni-Abrahams must still appear in court next month. "Ndabeni-Abrahams was charged with contravention of regulation 11B of the Disaster Management Act and was served with a summons to appear in the Pretoria District Court on 22 May 2020, with an admission of guilt fine of R1,000 set,” NPA Gauteng spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said in a statement. “The admission of guilt fine is as per determination by the senior magistrate for the Magisterial District of Tshwane where the amount of R1,000 has been set for the offence of failure to confine oneself to his/her place of residence,” she added. Mjonondwane said the NPA remained committed in delivering justice without fear, favour or prejudice. “This penalty should send a message that all citizens are equal in the eyes of the law,” she said.
