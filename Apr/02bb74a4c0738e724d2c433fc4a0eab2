DA leader John Steenhuisen said the WhatsApp line, which would be monitored by members of the party's security and justice cluster, could also be used to seek legal guidance. “The last thing we want is a flareup between security personnel and citizens during this critical time. Citizens are urged to abide by the regulations of the lockdown but equally so, security personnel are urged to self-restraint and ensure that any action that they take abides by the civil rights and people’s rights are not infringed upon.”
