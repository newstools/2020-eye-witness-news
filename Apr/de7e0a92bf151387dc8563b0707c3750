The other procedure that we need to follow is the number of people that can attend. We will try very hard to stick to 50 people.” Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa has sent his condolences to Mbhele’s family, as well as the families of two other pensioners who also passed away on Monday, while collecting their social grants.
