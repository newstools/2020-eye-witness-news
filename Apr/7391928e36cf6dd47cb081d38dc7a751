Despite its immense workload, Nxesi said the UIF was functioning. He said the fund had assisted over 600,000 workers with many more waiting for help. “I need to state unambiguously that the UIF is delivering. By the end of business yesterday, the UIF paid out R1.6 billion for the monies set aside for COVID-19,” Nxesi said.
