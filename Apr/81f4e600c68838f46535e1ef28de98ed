Soshanguve High School was severely damaged in the latest fire on Wednesday. This morning itâ€™s Soshanguve Secondary School. We lost four schools in a week @SAPoliceService @Steve_Mabona pic.twitter.com/OnfDVPdUVM  It is the fourth school to be targeted in the area during the national lockdown. Lesufi said that his department was looking for answers. "It's quite clear that if you burn down a school, you're angry about something and we want to know why you're angry. Why would you burn a place that will assist your own child? We have 22 vandalised schools in Gauteng thus far, and in Soshanguve, within a week, four schools have burned down."
