Nzimande said they should join the rest of the country in adhering with the regulations of the 21-day national lockdown. “President has said to me that I must say a few things to you; firstly, that he is very happy that you have been very disciplined and allowed to be quarantined here, but most importantly that we have all been declared negative.” Four students who arrived at a later date will remain under quarantine at the hotel.
