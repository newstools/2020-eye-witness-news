CAPE TOWN - Groote Schuur Hospital has seen a massive drop in trauma cases since the national lockdown  was implemented. This comes on the back of a steep decline in serious and violent crimes since the start of the 21-day lockdown. Head of Groote Schuur Hospital's Trauma Unit Andrew Nicol said: “We’re so used to seeing large numbers of gunshot injuries... up to about 85 per month. Suddenly to have that taken off our hands is a huge relief because that takes up a huge amount of our resources.” Listen to Andrew Nicol’s interview on CapeTalk below:  For official information about COVID-19 from the Department of Health, please click here.
