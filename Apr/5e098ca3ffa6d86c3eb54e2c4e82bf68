Creative Graphics International, which normally makes badges for the automotive industry, was shut due to the lockdown. CAPE TOWN - A Cape Town-based manufacturer is back in business, producing face shields to help in the fight against COVID-19. Creative Graphics International, which normally makes badges for the automotive industry, was shut due to the lockdown. However, it's now making personal protective equipment for medical personnel and the general public. With news of the country's lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19, the small-to-medium sized business based in Ottery, Cape Town, also had to close its doors. Managing director Shaun Rosenstein said a request for the production of face shields from a customer, whose business could continue operating under lockdown conditions, allowed them to shift gears. “She asked if we could do face shields and I just said yes we can, of course we can do it.” Rosenstein said with social-distancing and temperature screening protocols in place, about 30% of the company's staff of around 170 workers could return to work on this new project. “If I can bring back all my staff, it would be the ultimate blessing for me. I’ll know that they are covered from a salary point of view.” Medical experts have advised how the face shield should be constructed for health workers. #Covid19inSA #WC A Cape Town-based manufacturer has repurposed its operations to produce Personal Protective Equipment.
