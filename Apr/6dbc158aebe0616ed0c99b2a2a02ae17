The store has been opened throughout the lockdown period as part of essential services. This comes after 24 workers also tested positive for the virus at a Dischem in Boksburg. The Pick n Pay store at Alex Mall has been temporarily closed after two workers tested positive for the coronavirus. On Monday, Pick n Pay said it had traced those who had been in close contact with the two and they had been sent into self-quarantine. The storeâ€™s management said as a precaution, they had also organised that all of the staff be screened by health practitioners. Pick n Pay said it was sanitising and deep cleaning the store and that branch would reopen once this process was completed. This is not the first Pick n Pay store to close  its doors because of coronavirus infections. Last week, the PnP at the  Waterstone Village, in Somerset West, was temporarily closed after a staffer tested positive for COVID-19.
