Minister Didiza has announced some relief for struggling small-scale farmers in the country in a bid to ensure that food production is not compromised during the coronavirus pandemic. "We also would like to indicate that those farmers who support must also be applying good farming practices because this is important in order to protect our environment and we maintain our soils for further production." Didiza has encouraged farmers in traditional areas to also apply. "We will ensure that we identify and target women, at least 50% of those who have applied, youth 40%, and people with disabilities at 6%." The minister has once again cautioned South Africans against panic buying, warning that if people continued to buy more than what they need it may lead to food price hikes.
