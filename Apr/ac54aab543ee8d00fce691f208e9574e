This year, Easter celebrations will be coming to people’s homes. JOHANNESBURG - For many, the Easter  period is a time to be with friends and family or observe religious celebrations. But with the nationwide lockdowns around the world and here in South Africa, things have taken a different turn across the globe. This year, Easter celebrations will be coming to people’s homes. At The Vatican, Pope Francis will be sharing messages throughout the weekend via The Vatican's YouTube channel. MultiChoice has launched a pop-up DStv channel where it will broadcast content from Thursday, 9 April, until Monday, 13 April.
