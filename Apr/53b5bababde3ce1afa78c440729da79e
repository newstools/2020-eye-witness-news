The MEC and mayors agreed on a comprehensive strategy to deal with land invasion in the province. Maile said they would work with law enforcement agencies to deal with land invasions. "Anybody who invades [land] during the lockdown, we are not going to say it’s during the lockdown and we'll wait. We’ll move in, we prevent it, and arrest them," he said.
