The city’s mayoral committee member for human settlements, Malusi Booi, said the illegal occupation of land was in contempt of a court order. “Process and procedure have been followed. Our teams are well aware of our processes, they just don’t come to any area [and demolish homes ]. They also give notices to such residents,” Booi said. Khayelitsha Community Action Network leader Ntsiki Dlulani said there was public order police. “Law enforcement came and they started again to demolish people’s homes… we’ve been trying to assist the community to calm down because there’s nothing they can do at this point,” Dlulani said.
