JOHANNESBURG - Some foreign nationals trapped in the country may be able to head home as South African Airways (SAA) has agreed to provide repatriation charter flights to various international destinations. In a statement on Thursday morning, the airline said that the first of these chartered flights would be for the repatriation of German citizens to their home country. They are expected to start operating on Friday from Johannesburg to Munich and from Cape Town to Frankfurt. South Africa is now in the seventh day of the announced 21-day national lockdown, which began on 26 March and led to borders being closed and passenger flights being cancelled. As a result, many foreign passengers, including workers, tourists and students were not able to change their travel plans in time to return to their home countries. After meeting with various embassies, SAA has agreed to assist these people to travel home provided they haven't tested positive for COVID-19. The airline's spokesperson Tlali Tlali: "We are currently in negotiations with a number of embassies representing a number of countries all over the world. Our negotiations are at an advanced stage in so far as the government of Brazil and Belgium are concerned. Those are some of the countries for the first batch of flights that will operate out of South Africa."
