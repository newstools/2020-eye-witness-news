The Money Show’s Bruce Whitfield interviews Ben Bierman of Business Partners Limited, the company administering Rupert’s fund.  Johann Rupert’s R1 billion Sukuma Relief Programme has started distributing funds to Covid-19 affected businesses. The fund is administered by Business Partners Limited.   Sole proprietors can get a grant of R25 000 while companies can apply for a loan of up to R1 million in addition to the R25 000 grant. Business Partners have temporarily halted applications due to the overwhelming number of applications, totalling R2.4 billion. The Money Show’s Bruce Whitfield asked Business Partners Limited’s Ben Bierman how his company is planning to administer Rupert’s funding to small businesses. The company I work for was created by Johann [Rupert]… He challenged us to come up with ideas… He shared it with the President, and we got cracking! … We didn’t anticipate being oversubscribed so quickly…  Mr Rupert has a soft spot for sole proprietors. We weren’t comfortable, because we don’t often serve them…  It is absolutely a donation… not a single cent will flow back to Mr Rupert… We’re not making any money out of it…  The Trust will open to accept additional donations…  We don’t provide relief to a business that was in trouble [before Covid-19] …  FNB was amazing… they’re assisting us with fraud checking… We started dispersing today…  We sign a very simple loan agreement… entrepreneurs pay it forward… repayments will contribute to future initiatives…  Only the best will survive, but we need to save as many as possible…  For more detail, listen to the interview in the audio below.
