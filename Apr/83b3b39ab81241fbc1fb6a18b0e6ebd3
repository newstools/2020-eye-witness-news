Last month, 2,820 members were deployed to patrol the streets and man roadblocks. Along with police, the army was deployed to maintain law and order. As the number of coronavirus infections in the country is rising, so too has the need to tighten measures to control the pandemic. An additional 73,180 soldiers will be deployed from 2 April until 26 June.
