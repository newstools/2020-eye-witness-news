A post shared by  Zola Hashatsi (@zola_hashatsi) on Apr 6, 2020 at 7:42am PDT  V-Mash, as Mashego was affectionately known, was a prominent actress on various Sepedi SABC dramas in the 1980s. But it is as a presenter on music show _Jam Alley _that she is most famous for, so much so that even today, popular catchphrases such "azange bangani" she coined are still used and instantly linked to her. Our #TBT is the famous #JamAlley on @mzansi_fosho by @nimrodnkosi and Vinolia Mashego ‚ù§Ô∏è #tsaon3 #tsaon3 Video credit: YouTube pic.twitter.com/D4FwvAvCEl  Mashego fell on hard times post her departure from Jam Alley in the early 2000s. Gigs dried up and she eventually was forced to move back home to live with her parents. A few other jobs came across her path some years later, notably a role on Mzansi Magic drama Isibaya season two and most recently, as a presenter on prank show Bheka Sikumbambile on Moja Love, which premiered in March 2020 and an appearance on SABC 2 drama Giyani.
