All those taking part in the event, organised by the WHO and Global Citizen, will appear remotely due to social distancing and shutdowns aimed at curtailing the spread of the disease. LOS ANGELES - Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lopez, and Oprah Winfrey have joined a global broadcast special telecast this weekend that will recognise the efforts of workers on the front lines of the coronavirus  outbreak, organisers said on Tuesday. The _One World Together at Home _event, a combination of music, comedy, and stories from doctors, nurses, and grocery workers, also announced an additional six-hour streaming event that will include appearances by major sports stars, including British Formula One racing champion Lewis Hamilton, US women‚Äôs World Cup soccer player Megan Rapinoe, World Cup skier Lindsey Vonn and dozens of other singers, actors and social media influencers. The 18 April streaming event will precede the two-hour show to be broadcast across multiple North American and international television networks on Saturday evening in the biggest effort so far to show solidarity with frontline workers. All those taking part in the event, organised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and advocacy group Global Citizen, will appear remotely due to social distancing and shutdowns aimed at curtailing the spread of the disease that has killed more than 124,000 people worldwide. ‚ÄúOur hope for the special is that everyone will come away believing that we, as a shared humanity, can emerge from this moment forever grateful for the work of doctors, nurses, teachers, grocery store workers, and all those who are the backbone of our communities,‚Äù Hugh Evans, co-founder, and chief executive of Global Citizen, said in a statement. üö®BIG NEWS: We‚Äôve just announced MORE ARTISTS for One World: #TogetherAtHome, including @JLo, @Oprah, @taylorswift13, and more.
