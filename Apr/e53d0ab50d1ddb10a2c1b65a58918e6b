Forty-one-year-old James Hackett and 38-year-old Erkan Bali allegedly flouted the Disaster Management Act by entering the country on Sunday. DURBAN - The two British men accused of entering the country illegally from eSwatini have now been placed in quarantine at a Durban hospital. James Hackett and Erkan Bali, whom the court has clarified to be aged 41 and 38 receptively, allegedly flouted the Disaster Management Act by entering the country on Sunday. The Durban Magistrates Court heard on Tuesday that the pair have been tested for COVID-19 and were awaiting their results. Hackett and Bali are accused of being in possession of a stolen vehicle, violating the Immigration Act and contravening the regulations of the National Disaster Management Act. The pair allegedly evaded arrest at the Golela border post between South Africa and eSwatini by speeding off from law enforcement officers. Eyewitness News understands that a local guesthouse owner who was arrested with the pair was released on bail on Sunday but is yet to appear in court. THE LATEST ON COVID-19 CASES IN SA •    There are currently 2,272 COVID-19 cases since the disease first arrived in SA, •    The total number of dead now stands at 27 – another two deaths confirmed on Tuesday, one in the Western Cape (a diabetic hypertensive man), one in Gauteng with no known underlying diseases, •    Health minister revealed that more than 438,000 people have been screened. Of those, 4,537 have been referred for testing, •    Contact tracers have identified 11,406 contacts of the people who have tested positive, and most have been identified, interviewed and processed, •    In total - 87,022 tests have been completed – just over 21,000 if those are in the public sector – that number is ticking up nicely –  this is important because the mass screening and testing campaign is what is going to give us a true sense of the state of play, •    The daily numbers are not live – they get closed off at midnight each day, and then calculated and reconciled during the day before they are released – so, there's a slight lag on a daily basis.
