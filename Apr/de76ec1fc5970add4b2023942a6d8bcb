Ntombikayise Simanga, who has lived at the shelter with her two children for a year, says they are in desperate need of assistance. “Our biggest worry is getting infected because we are living here with so many families. We are fearing for our lives.” Ethekwini municipal spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela says their biggest challenge has been finding land for the disaster victims but they have now made progress. “We have secured land and awe are very optimistic that they will be relocated to land that is suitable for human settlement. It's not because they have been forgotten.” Mayisela said in the meantime a team has been set up to ensure that victims of the 2019 disaster are protected against the coronavirus.
