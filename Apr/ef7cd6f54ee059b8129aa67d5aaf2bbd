The city's economic development department started issuing temporary permits for traders earlier on Tuesday.

Informal food trading, excluding cooked food, is being allowed again under lockdown regulations. This includes fruit and vegetables, fresh meat and fish, sweets and cool drinks. Trading hours are between 8 am to 5 pm. However, traders have to wear personal protective equipment, which includes a mask, sanitisers and gloves. Regulations were amended by Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma last week, allowing for informal food trading with the proper permit. This permit is applicable for the 21-day lockdown period only which government put in place to curb the spread of coronavirus. Under this period, only essential service workers are allowed to continue work while the rest of the country is expected to stay at home. On Monday, the City of Joburg managed to grant more than 700 permits. Additional reporting by Kaylynn Palm.
