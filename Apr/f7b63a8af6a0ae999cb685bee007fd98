Boris Johnson is the most high-profile leader to suffer from the coronavirus. LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson  said on Sunday that "things could have gone either way" in his struggle against coronavirus  in a video recorded after he left hospital following intensive care treatment. "I hope they won't mind if I mention in particular two nurses who stood by my bedside for 48 hours when things could have gone either way," he said, as he praised his medical team at London's St Thomas' Hospital.  Johnson said Britain "will defeat" the coronavirus pandemic. "We will defeat this coronavirus and defeat it together," the 55-year-old leader said, seated and dressed in a suit and tie. "Though the struggle is by no means over, we are now making progress in this incredible national battle." Johnson is the most high-profile leader to suffer from the coronavirus. It is unclear how quickly he will be able to return to work, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab currently deputising for him.
